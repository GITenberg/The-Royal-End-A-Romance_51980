    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ALZATORE, by many
      coquetries, had long been trying to attract their attention. At last he
      had succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an admirer,&rdquo; Ruth, with a gleam, remarked to her companion.
      &ldquo;Mercy, how he's ogling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lucilla Dor, untroubled, in that contented, caressing
      voice of hers, while, her elbow on the table, with the &ldquo;languid grace,&rdquo;
       about which Ruth chaffed her a good deal, she pensively nibbled a fig.
      &ldquo;The admiration is reciprocal. What a handsome fellow he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her soft blue eyes smiled straight into Balzatore's eager brown ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quivering with emotion, Balzatore sprang up, and in another second would
      have bounded to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sir; where are you going?&rdquo; sternly interposed Bertram. Placed
      with his back towards the ladies, he was very likely unaware of their
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balzatore sat down, but he gave his head a toss that clearly signified his
      opinion of the restraint put upon him: senselessly conventional,
      monstrously annoying. And he gave Lucilla Dor a look. Disappointment spoke
      in it, homage, dogged&mdash;'tis a case for saying so&mdash;dogged
      tenacity of purpose. &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; it promised, &ldquo;I'll find an opportunity
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found it, sure enough, some twenty minutes later.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ruth and Lucilla had been dining at the Lido, at the new hotel there, I
      forget its name, the only decent hotel, in a sandy garden near the
      Stabilimento. They had dined in the air, of course, on the terrace, whence
      they could watch the sunset burn and die over Venice, and the moon come up
      out of the Adriatic. Balzatore had been dining with Bertram at a
      neighbouring table.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, her eyes intently lifted, as in prayer, Lucilla began to adjust
      her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't stop here nibbling figs forever,&rdquo; she premised, with the drawl,
      whimsically plaintive, that she is apt to assume in her regretful moods.
      &ldquo;I think it's time to return to our mosquitoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they paid their bill, and set off, through the warm night and the
      moonlight and the silence, down the wide avenue of plane-trees that leads
      from the sea to the lagoon. In the moonlight and the silence, they were
      themselves silent at first, walking slowly, feeling the pleasant solemnity
      of things. Then, all at once, Lucilla softly sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Byron,&rdquo; she said, as from the depths of a pious reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Byron?&rdquo; wondered Ruth, called perhaps from reveries of her own. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He used to come here to ride,&rdquo; explained Lucilla, in a breaking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm afraid Ruth tittered. Afterwards they were silent again, the silence
      of the night reasserting itself, and holding them like music, till, by and
      by, their progress ended at the landing-stage where they had left their
      gondola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has become of the wretched thing?&rdquo; asked Lucilla, looking
      blankly this way and that. For the solitary gondola tied up there wasn't
      theirs. She turned vaguely to the men in charge of it, meditating
      enquiries: when one of them, with the intuition and the aplomb of his
      race, took the words out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Lordessa,&rdquo; he said, touching his hat. &ldquo;If you are seeking the
      boatmen who brought you here, they went back as soon as they had put you
      ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla eyed him coldly, distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went back?&rdquo; she doubted. &ldquo;But I told them to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shrugged, a shrug of sympathy, of fatalism. &ldquo;Ech!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
      could not have understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla frowned, weighing credibilities; then her brow cleared, as in
      sudden illumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did not pay them,&rdquo; she remembered, and cited the circumstance as
      conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, however, made light of it. &ldquo;Ech!&rdquo; he said, with genial
      confidence. &ldquo;They belong to your hotel. You will pay them to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, anyhow, my dear,&rdquo; suggested Ruth, intervening, &ldquo;as they're nowhere
      in mortal sight...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see that this is a trick?&rdquo; Lucilla stopped her, in a heated
      whisper. &ldquo;What you call collusion. They're lurking somewhere round a
      corner, so that we shall have to engage these creatures, and be let in for
      two fares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; murmured Ruth, admiring. &ldquo;Who would have thought them so
      imaginative?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla sniffed. &ldquo;Oh, they're Italians,&rdquo; she scornfully pointed out. &ldquo;Ah,
      well, the gods love a cheerful victim. You will do,&rdquo; she said to the man.
      &ldquo;Take us to the Britannia.&rdquo; And she motioned to Ruth to place herself
      under the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man, touching his hat again, stood, very deferentially, with bent
      back, so as to bar the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Lordessa,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so many excuses&mdash;we are private;&rdquo; while
      his glance, not devoid of vainglory, embracing himself and his colleague,
      invited attention to the spruce nautical liveries they were wearing, and
      to the silver badges on their arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Lucilla Dor stared stonily at him. &ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; she pronounced,
      with fervour, under her breath. Then her blue eyes gazed, wide and
      wistful, at the moonlit waters, beyond which the lamps along the Riva
      twinkled pallid derision. &ldquo;How are we to get to Venice?&rdquo; she demanded
      helplessly of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go back for the night to the hotel here,&rdquo; said Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With no luggage? Two women alone? Never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; scoffed
      Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; Ruth submitted, &ldquo;I believe the lagoon is nowhere very deep.
      We might try to ford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you think it's a laughing matter!&rdquo; Lucilla, with an ominous lilt,
      threw out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the two gondoliers had been conferring together; they conducted
      their conference with so much vehemence, one might have fancied they were
      quarelling, but that was only the gondolier of it; and now, he who had
      heretofore remained in the background, stepped forward, and in a tone, all
      Italian, of respectfully benevolent protection, addressed Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scusi, Madama, we will ask our Signore to let you come with us. There is
      plenty of room. Only, we must wait till he arrives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed she, with relief. But in a minute, &ldquo;Who is your Signore?&rdquo;
       caution prompted her to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a signorino,&rdquo; the man replied, and I'm sure he thought the reply
      enlightening. &ldquo;He is very good-natured. He will let you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it happened just at this point, while they stood there hesitating,
      that Balzatore found his opportunity.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      One heard a tattoo of scampering paws, a sibilance of swift breathing; and
      a cold wet nose, followed by a warm furry head, was thrust from behind
      under Lucilla's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled, she gave an inevitable little feminine cry, and half turned
      round&mdash;to recognise her late admirer. &ldquo;Hello, old fellow&mdash;is
      this you?&rdquo; she greeted him, patting his shoulder, stroking his silky ears.
      &ldquo;You take one rather by surprise, you know. Yes, you are a very beautiful,
      nice, friendly collie, all the same; and I never saw so handsome a coat,
      or so splendid a tail, or such soulful poetic eyes. I am very glad to
      renew your acquaintance.&rdquo; Balzatore waved his splendid tail as if it were
      a banner; rubbed his jowl against Lucilla's knee; caracoled and pranced
      before her, to display his graces; cocked his head, and blinked with
      self-satisfaction; sat down on his haunches, and, tongue lolling from his
      black muzzle, panted exultantly, &ldquo;There! You see how cleverly I have
      brought it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ecco. That is our Signore's dog,&rdquo; announced the man who had promised
      intercession. &ldquo;He himself will not be far behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word, appeared, approaching, the tall and slender figure of
      Bertram, to whom, in a sudden contrapuntal outburst, both gondoliers began
      to speak Venetian. They spoke rapidly, turbulently almost, with many
      modulations, with lavish gestures, vividly, feelingly, each exposed the
      ladies' case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, his grey eyes smiling (you know that rather deep-in, flickering
      smile of goodwill of theirs), removed his panama hat and said, in
      perfectly English English, with the accent of a man praying a particular
      favour, &ldquo;I beg you to let them take you to your hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant, the gondoliers steadying their craft, Lucilla murmuring
      what she could by way of thanks, he had helped them aboard, and, after a
      quick order to the men, was bowing god-speed to them from the
      landing-stage, while one hand, by the collar, held captive a tugging,
      impetuous Balzatore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucilla, puzzled. &ldquo;Do you not also go to Venice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they will come back for me,&rdquo; said Bertram, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight movement to her head, slight but decisive, a movement
      that implied finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't think of such a thing,&rdquo; in the tone of an ultimatum she
      declared. &ldquo;It's extremely good of you to offer us a lift&mdash;but we
      simply can't accept it if it means inconvenience to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bertram, of course, at once ceded the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bowing again, &ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wasn't sure we shouldn't
      be in your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his seat, keeping Balzatore restive between his knees.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      The gondoliers bent rhythmically to their oars, the gondola went gently
      plump-plump, plash-plash, over the smooth water, stirring faint
      intermittent breezes; far and wide the lagoon lay dim and blue in a fume
      of moonlight, silent, secret, even somehow almost sinister in its
      untranslatable suggestions; and before them rose the domes and palaces of
      Venice, pale and luminous, with purple blacknesses of shadow, unreal,
      mysterious, dream-compelling, as a city built of cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perilous seas in faery lands forlorn,&rdquo; Lucilla&mdash;need I mention?&mdash;quoted
      to herself, and if she didn't quote it aloud, that, I suppose, was due to
      the presence of Bertram. She and Ruth sat close together, with their faces
      towards the prow, where, like a battle-axe clearing their way of unseen
      foes, the ferro swayed and gleamed; he, sidewise, removed a little to
      their left. And all three were mum as strangers in a railway carriage.
      But, like strangers in a railway carriage, they were no doubt more or less
      automatically, subconsciously, taking one another in, observing,
      classifying. &ldquo;I wonder whether he's really English,&rdquo; Lucilla thought. He
      spoke and dressed like an Englishman, to be sure, yet so many Italians
      nowadays do that; and, with a private gondola, he presumably lived in
      Venice; and there was something&mdash;in the aquiline cut of his features?&mdash;in
      his pointed beard?&mdash;that seemed foreign. &ldquo;Anyhow, he's a gentleman,&rdquo;
       she gratefully reflected; and thereat, her imagination taking wing,
      &ldquo;Suppose he had been an ogre or a bounder?&mdash;or a flamboyant native
      lady-killer?&mdash;or a little fat oily <i>crafaud de Juif?</i> Besides,
      he has nice eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About the nationality of his guests, Bertram, of course, could entertain
      no question, nor about their place in the world; in their frocks, their
      hats, their poise of head, turn of hand, in the general unself-conscious
      selfassurance of their bearing, they wore their social history for daws to
      peck at; one's eye, as it rested on them, instinctively supplied a
      background of Mayfair, with a perspective of country houses. A thing that
      teased him, however, was an absurd sense that he had somewhere seen
      Lucilla before, seen her, known her, though he perfectly knew he hadn't.
      Her youthfully mature beauty, her bigness, plumpness, smoothness, her
      blondeur; those deceptively child-like blue eyes of hers, with their
      superficial effect of wondering innocence, and their interior sparkle of
      observant, experienced humour, under those improbably dark and regular
      brows&mdash;such delicate and equal crescents as to avow themselves the
      creation of her pencil; the glossy abundance of her light-brown hair; her
      full, soft, pleasure-loving mouth and chin, their affluent good-nature
      tempered by the danger you divined of a caustic wit in the upward perk of
      her rather short nose; the whole easygoing, indolent, sensuous&mdash;sociable,
      comfortable, indulgent&mdash;watchful, critical, ironic&mdash;aura of the
      woman: no, he told himself, she was not a person he could ever have known
      and forgotten, she was too distinctly differentiated an individual. Then
      how account for that teasing sense of recognition? He couldn't account for
      it, and he couldn't shake it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Ruth (egregious circumstance) he was aware at the time of noticing no
      more than, vaguely, that the young girl under Lucilla's chaperonage was
      pretty and pleasant-looking!
    </p>
    <p>
      All three sat as mum as strangers in a railway carriage, but I can't think
      it was the mumness of embarrassment. I can hardly imagine a woman less shy
      than Lucilla, a man less shy than Bertram; embarrassment is an ill it were
      difficult to conceive befalling either of them. No, I conjecture it was
      simply the mumness of people who, having said all that was essential, were
      sufficiently unembarrassed not to feel that they must, nevertheless,
      bother to say something more. And when, for example, Bertram, having
      unwittingly relaxed his grip upon Balzatore's collar, that irrepressible
      bundle of life escaped to Lucilla's side and recommenced his
      blandishments, they spoke readily and easily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't let him bore you,&rdquo; Bertram said, with a kind of tentative
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Lucilla, &ldquo;he delights me. He's so friendly, and so
      handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not so handsome as he thinks he is,&rdquo; said Bertram. &ldquo;He's the vainest
      coxcomb of my acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all dogs are vain,&rdquo; said Lucilla; &ldquo;that is what establishes the
      fellow-feeling between them and us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To such modicum of truth as this proposition may not have been without,
      Bertram's quiet laugh seemed a tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he was a collie,&rdquo; Lucilla continued, in a key of doubt. &ldquo;But
      isn't he rather big for a collie? Is he an Italian breed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a most unlikely hybrid,&rdquo; Bertram answered. &ldquo;He's half a collie, and
      half a Siberian wolf-hound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wolf-hound?&rdquo; cried Lucilla, a little alarmed perhaps at the way in
      which she'd been making free with him; and she fell back, to put him at
      arm's length. &ldquo;Mercy, how savage that sounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; acknowledged Bertram; &ldquo;but he's a living paradox. The wolf-hound
      blood has turned to ethereal mildness in his veins. And he's a very
      perfect coward. I've seen him run from a goose, and in the house my cat
      holds him under a reign of terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla's alarm was stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darling, did they abuse you? No, they shouldn't,&rdquo; she said, in a
      voice of deep commiseration, pressing Balzatore's head to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gondola, impelled by its two stalwart oarsmen, was making
      excellent speed. They had passed the sombre mass of San Servolo, the
      boscage, silver and sable in moonlight and shadow, of the Public Gardens;
      and now, with San Giorgio looming at their left, were threading an
      anchored fleet of steamers and fishing-smacks, towards the entrance of the
      Grand Canal: whence, already, they could hear the squalid caterwauling of
      those rival boatloads of beggars, who, on the vain theory of their being
      musicians, are suffered nightly, before the congeries of hotels, to render
      the hours hideous and hateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in no time, they had reached the water-steps of the Britannia,
      and a gold-laced Swiss was aiding mesdames to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night&mdash;and thank you so very much,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;We should
      have had to camp at the Lido if you hadn't come to our rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only too glad to have been of the slightest use,&rdquo; Bertram assured
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Ruth with a little nod and smile&mdash;the first sign
      she had made him, the first word she had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hat. Balzatore, fore paws on the seat, tail aloft, head
      thrust forward, gave a yelp of reluctant valediction (or was it indignant
      protest and recall?). The ladies vanished through the great doorway; the
      incident was closed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      The incident was closed;&mdash;and, in a way, for Bertram, as the event
      proved, it had yet to begin. His unknown &ldquo;guests of hazard&rdquo; had departed,
      disappeared; but they had left something behind them that was as real as
      it was immaterial, a sense of fluttering garments, of faint fleeting
      perfumes, of delicate and mystic femininity. The incident was closed, and
      now, as the strong ashen sweeps bore him rapidly homewards between the
      unseen palaces of the Grand Canal, it began to re-enact itself; and a
      hundred details, a hundred graces, unheeded at the moment, became vivid to
      him. Two women, standing in a rain of moonlight, by the landing-stage at
      the Lido, brightly silhouetted against the dim lagoon; the sudden
      tumultuous exordium of his men; his own five words with Lucilla, and the
      high-bred musical English voice in which she had answered him; then their
      presence, gracious and distinguished, there beside him in the bend of the
      boat,&mdash;their cool, summery toilets, the entire fineness and finish of
      their persons; and the wide, moonlit water, and the play of the moonlight
      on the ripples born of their progress, and the wide silence, punctured, as
      in a sort of melodious pattern, by the recurrent dip and drip of the oars;
      it all came back, but with an atmosphere, a fragrance, but with overtones
      of suggestion, even of sentiment, that he had missed. It all came back,
      unfolding itself as a continuous picture; and what therein, of all, came
      back with the most insistent clearness was the appearance of the young
      girl who had so mutely effaced herself in her companion's shadow, and
      whom, at the time (egregious circumstance), he had just vaguely noticed as
      pretty and pleasant-looking. This came back with insistent, with
      disturbing clearness, a visible thing of light in his memory; and he saw,
      with a kind of bewilderment at his former blindness, that her prettiness
      was a prettiness full of distinctive character, and that if she was
      &ldquo;pleasant-looking&rdquo; it was with a pleasantness as remote as possible from
      insipid sweetness. Even in her figure, which was so far typical as to be
      slender and girlish, he could perceive something that marked it as
      singular, a latent elasticity of fibre, a hint, as it were, of high
      energies quiescent; but when he considered her face, he surprised himself
      by actually muttering aloud, &ldquo;Upon my word, it's the oddest face I think I
      have ever seen.&rdquo; Odd&mdash;and pretty? Yes, pretty, or more than pretty,
      he was quite confident of that; yet pretty notwithstanding an absolutely
      defiant irregularity of features. Or stay&mdash;irregularity? No,
      unconventionality, rather: for the features in question were so congruous
      and coherent with one another, so sequent in their correlation, as to
      establish a regularity of their own. The discreet but resolute salience of
      her jaw and chin, the assertive lines of her brow and nose, the crisp
      chiselling of her lips, the size and shape of her eyes, and over all the
      crinkling masses of her dark hair&mdash;unconventional as you will, he
      said, not attributable to any ready-made category, but everywhere
      expressing design, unity of design. &ldquo;High energies quiescent,&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;You discern them in her face as in her figure; a capacity for
      emotions and enthusiasms; a temperament that would feel things with
      intensity. And yet,&rdquo; he reflected, perpending his image of her with
      leisurely deliberation, &ldquo;what in her face strikes one first, I think,
      what's nearest to the surface, is a kind of sceptic humour,&mdash;as if
      she took the world with a grain of salt, and were having a quiet laugh at
      it in the back of her mind. And then her colouring,&rdquo; he again surprised
      himself by muttering aloud. But when could he have observed her colouring,
      he wondered, when, where? Not in the colour-obliterating moonlight, of
      course. Where, then? Ah, suddenly he remembered. He saw her standing under
      the electric lamps on the steps of the Britannia. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said,
      giving him a quick little nod, a brief little smile. And he saw how red
      her mouth was, and how red her blood, beneath the translucent whiteness of
      her skin, and how in the glow of her brown eyes there shone a red
      undergleam, and how in her crinkling masses of dark hair there were
      dark-red lights....
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident was closed, in its substance, really, as matter-of-fact a
      little incident as one could fancy; but the savour of it lingered,
      persisted, kept recurring, and was sweet and poignant, like a savour of
      romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall never see them again,&rdquo; was his unwilling but stoical
      conclusion, as the gondola shot through the water-gate of Cà Bertradoni.
      &ldquo;I wonder who they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      He saw them again, however, no later than the next afternoon, and learned
      who they were. He was seated with dark, lantern-jawed, deepeyed,
      tragical-looking Lewis Vincent, under the colonnade at the Florian, when
      they passed, in the full blaze of the sun, down the middle of the Piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Vincent, in the light and cheerful voice, that contrasted so
      surprisingly with the dejected droop of his moustaches, &ldquo;there goes the
      richest spinster in England.&rdquo; He nodded towards their retreating backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Bertram, raising interested eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the thin girl in grey, with the white sunshade,&rdquo; Vincent
      apprised him. &ldquo;Been bestowing largesse on the pigeons, let us hope. The
      Rubensy-looking woman with her is Lady Dor&mdash;a sister of Harry
      Pontycroft's. I think you know Pontycroft, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram showed animation. &ldquo;I know him very well indeed&mdash;we've been
      friends for years&mdash;I'm extremely fond of him. That's his sister? I've
      never met his people. Dor, did you say her name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife of Sir Frederick Dor, of Dortown, an Irishman, a Roman Catholic, and
      a Unionist M.P.,&rdquo; answered Vincent, and it seemed uncanny in a way to hear
      the muse of small-talk speaking from so tenebrous a mien. &ldquo;The thin girl
      is a Miss Ruth Adgate&mdash;American, I believe, but domiciled in England.
      You must have seen her name in the newspapers&mdash;they've had a lot
      about her, apropos of one thing or another; and the other day she
      distinguished herself at the sale of the Rawleigh collection, by paying
      three thousand pounds for one of the Karasai ivories&mdash;record price, I
      fancy. She's said to have a bagatelle of something like fifty thousand a
      year in her own right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; murmured Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could account now for his puzzled feeling last night, that he had
      seen Lucilla before. With obvious unlikenesses&mdash;for where she was
      plump and smooth, pink and white, Harry Pontycroft was brown and lined and
      bony&mdash;there still existed between her and her brother a resemblance
      so intimate, so essential, that our friend could only marvel at his
      failure to think of it at once. 'Twas a resemblance one couldn't easily
      have localised, but it was intimate and essential and unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is Ponty's sister. I see. I understand,&rdquo; he mused aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lewis Vincent, stretching his long legs under the table, while
      a soul in despair seemed to gaze from his haggard face. &ldquo;She looks like a
      fair, fat, feminine incarnation of Ponty himself, doesn't she? Funny
      thing, family likeness; hard to tell what it resides in. Not in the
      features, certainly; not in the flesh at all, I expect. In the spirit&mdash;it's
      metaphysical. One might know Lady Dor anywhere for Pontycroft's sister;
      yet externally she's as unlike him as a pat of butter is unlike a walnut.
      But it's the spirit showing through, the kindred spirit, the sister
      spirit? What? You don't think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I think you're quite right,&rdquo; answered Bertram, a trifle
      perfunctorily perhaps. &ldquo;By the by, I wish you'd introduce me to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? I?&rdquo; exclaimed Vincent, sitting up and opening his deep eyes wide,
      with a burlesque of astonishment that was plainly intended to convey a
      sarcasm. &ldquo;Bless your soul, <i>I</i> don't know her. I know Pontycroft, of
      course, as everybody does&mdash;or as everybody did, in the old days,
      before he came into his kingdom. It isn't so easy to make his acquaintance
      nowadays. But Lady Dor flies with the tippest of the toppest. And I, you
      see&mdash;well, I'm merely a well-born English gentleman. I ain't a duke,
      I ain't a Jew, and I ain't a millionaire cheesemonger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned his brow on the tips of his long slender fingers and gloomed
      blackly at the marble table-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Bertram with a not altogether happy chuckle. &ldquo;You mean that
      she's a snob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Vincent put in a quick disclaimer. &ldquo;Oh, no; oh dear, no. I don't know
      that she's a snob&mdash;any more than every one is in England. I mean that
      she happens to belong to the set that counts itself the smartest, just as
      I happen not to. It's mostly a matter of accident, I imagine. You fall
      where you fall. She isn't to blame for having fallen among the rich and
      great; and she looks like a very decent sort. But I say, if you really
      want to meet her, of course it would be the easiest thing in the world&mdash;for
      <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? How?&rdquo; asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Vincent, with the inflection and the gesture of a man
      expounding the self-evident, &ldquo;drop her a line at her hotel,&mdash;no
      difficulty in finding out where she's staying; at the Britannia, probably.
      Tell her you're an old friend of her brother's, and propose to call. I
      hope I don't need to say whether she'll jump at the chance when she sees
      your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't think I should care to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Vincent. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added after a minute, as a sort of <i>envoi</i>
      to his tale, &ldquo;rumour has it that Pontycroft and the heiress are by way of
      making a match. Well, why not? It would be inhuman to let her pass out of
      the family. Heigh? and the girl is really very pretty. Yes, I expect
      before a great while we'll read in the <i>Morning Post</i> that a marriage
      has been arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the next afternoon he saw them still again, and learned still
      more about them. Mrs. Wilberton, the brisk, well-dressed,
      elderly-handsome, amiably-worldly wife of the Bishop of Lanchester, was
      having tea with him on his balcony, when all at once she leaned forward,
      waved her hand, and bestowed her most radiant smile, her most gracious
      bow, upon the occupants of a passing gondola. Afterwards, turning to
      Bertram, her finely-modelled, fresh-complexioned face, under its pompadour
      of grey hair, charged with mystery and significance. &ldquo;Do you know those
      women?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, strictly speaking, he didn't know them; and his visitor's
      countenance was a promise as well as a provocative to curiosity; so I hope
      he was justified in answering, &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mystery and significance in Mrs. Wilberton's face had deepened to
      solemnity, to solemnity touched with severity. She sank back a little in
      her red-and-white cane armchair and slowly, solemnly shook her head. &ldquo;Ah,
      it's a sad scandal,&rdquo; she said, making her voice low and impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was leagues removed from anything that Bertram had bargained for.
      &ldquo;A scandal?&rdquo; he repeated, looking blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton fixed him with solemn eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;of a man, one of our great landowners,
      the head of one of our oldest families, a very rich man, a man named Henry
      Pontycroft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram smiled, though there was anxiety in his smile, though there was
      suspense. &ldquo;I know Henry Pontycroft very well,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Well, the elder of those two women was Henry
      Pontycroft's sister, Lucilla Dor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died away and she gazed at her listener in silence, meaningly,
      as if this announcement in itself contained material for pause and
      rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram was anxious, was in suspense. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said, his eyes,
      attentive and expectant, urging her to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's the other,&rdquo; she presently did continue, &ldquo;it's the young woman
      with her. Of course one has read of such things in the papers&mdash;one
      knows that they are done&mdash;but when they happen under one's own eyes,
      in one's own set! And she a Pontycroft! The other, the young woman with
      Lucilla Dor,&mdash;oh, it's quite too disgraceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Wilberton shook her head, this time with a kind of horrified
      violence, causing the jet spray in her bonnet to dance and twinkle, and
      again she sank back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram sat forward on the edge of his, hands clasping its arms. &ldquo;Yes?
      Yes?&rdquo; he prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an American,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilberton, speaking with an effect of
      forced calm. &ldquo;Her name is Ruth Adgate. She's an American of worse than
      common extraction, but she's immensely rich. It's really difficult to see
      in what she's better than an ordinary adventuress, but she has a hundred
      thousand pounds a year. And she's bought the Pontycrofts&mdash;Henry
      Pontycroft and his sister&mdash;she's bought them body and soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice indicated a full stop, and she allowed her face and attitude to
      relax, as one whose painful message was delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram looked perplexed. An adventuress? Of worse than common
      extraction? That fresh young girl, with her prettiness, her fineness? His
      impulse was to cry out, &ldquo;Allons donc!&rdquo; And then&mdash;the Pontycrofts?
      Frowning perplexity, he repeated his visitor's words: &ldquo;Bought the
      Pontycrofts? I don't think I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a thing that's done,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton assured him, on a note that
      was like a wail. &ldquo;One knows that it is done. It's a part of the degeneracy
      of our times. But the Pontycrofts! One would have thought <i>them</i>
      above it. And the Adgate woman! One would have thought that even people
      who are willing to sell themselves must draw the line somewhere. But no.
      Money is omnipotent. So, for money, the Pontycrofts have taken her to
      their bosoms; presented her; introduced her to every one; and they'll end,
      of course, by capturing a title for her. Another 'international marriage.'
      Another instance of American gold buying the due of well-born English
      girls over their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram smiled,&mdash;partly, it may be, at the passion his guest showed,
      but partly from relief. He had dreaded what was coming: what had come was
      agreeably inconclusive and unconvincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But surely this seems in the last degree improbable.
      What makes you think it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't that <i>I</i> think it,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton cried, with a
      movement that lifted the matter high above the plane of mere personal
      opinion; &ldquo;it's known,&mdash;it's known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram knitted his brows again. &ldquo;How can such a thing be <i>known?</i>&rdquo;
       he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At most, it can only be a suspicion or an inference. What makes you
      suspect it? What do you infer it <i>from?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, from the patent facts,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilberton, giving an upward motion
      to her pretty little white-gloved hands. &ldquo;They take her everywhere.
      They've presented her. They've introduced her to the best people. She's
      regularly <i>lancée</i> in their set. I myself was loth, loth to believe
      it. But the facts&mdash;they'll bear no other construction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram smiled again. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But why should you suppose that
      they do all this for money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His question appeared to take the lady's breath away. She sat up straight,
      lips parted, and gazed at him with something like stupefaction. &ldquo;For what
      other earthly reason should they do it?&rdquo; she was able, at last, in honest
      bewilderment, to gasp out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One has heard of such a motive-power as love,&rdquo; Bertram, with deference,
      submitted. &ldquo;Why shouldn't they do it because they like the girl&mdash;because
      she's their friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton breathed freely, and in her turn smiled. &ldquo;Ah, my dear
      Prince,&rdquo; she said, with a touch of pity, &ldquo;you don't know our English
      world. People in the Pontycroft's position don't take up nameless young
      Americans for love. Their lives are too full, too complicated. And it
      means an immense amount of work, of bother&mdash;you can't get a new-comer
      accepted without bestirring yourself, without watching, scheming,
      soliciting, contriving. And what's your reward? Your friends find you a
      nuisance, and no one thanks you. There's only one reward that can meet the
      case&mdash;payment in pounds sterling from your client's purse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram's incredulity was great. &ldquo;Harry Pontycroft is himself rich,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton at once assented, &ldquo;he's rich <i>now</i>. But he
      wasn't always rich. There were those lean years when he was merely his
      cousin's heir&mdash;and that's a whole chapter of the story. Besides, is
      his sister rich? Is Freddie Dor rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, about that of course I know nothing,&rdquo; Bertram had with humility to
      admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddie Dor is an Irish baronet, whose sole fortune consists of an Irish
      bog. Then where does Lucilla Dor get her money? She spends&mdash;there's
      no limit to the extravagance with which she spends, to the luxury in which
      she lives. She has a great house in town, a great house in the country&mdash;Lord
      Bylton's place, Knelworth Castle&mdash;she's taken it on a lease. She has
      a villa near Florence. She entertains like a duchess. She has a box at the
      opera. She has motor-cars and electric broughams&mdash;you know what <i>they</i>
      cost. And sables and diamonds, she has as many as an Indian begum. Where
      does she get her money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton eyed him with a kind of triumphant fierceness. Bertram had
      an uncomfortable laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's conceivable,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;that her husband's bog produces peat.
      But I should imagine, in the absence of other evidence, that her brother
      subsidises her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton stared at him for a second doubtfully. &ldquo;Of course you're
      not serious,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Brothers? Brothers don't do things on quite such
      a lavish scale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Ponty's different,&rdquo; Bertram argued. &ldquo;Ponty's eccentric. I could
      imagine Ponty doing things on a scale all his own. Anyhow, I don't see
      what there is to connect Lady Dor's affluence with Miss Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wilberton, with an air of being about to clench the
      matter, &ldquo;the connection is unfortunately glaring. Lady Dor's affluence
      dates precisely from the moment of Miss Adgate's entrance upon the scene.&rdquo;
       And with an air of <i>having</i> clenched the matter, she threw back her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram bent his brow, as one in troubled thought. Then, presently,
      reviewing his impressions, &ldquo;I never saw a nicer-looking girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      never saw a face that expressed finer or higher qualities. She doesn't
      look in the least like a girl with low ambitions,&mdash;like one who would
      try to buy her way into society, or pay people to find her a titled
      husband. And where, in all this, does Harry Pontycroft himself come in? I
      think you said that she had bought them both, brother and sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Wilberton, triumphing again, &ldquo;you touch the very point.
      Harry Pontycroft was head over ears in debt to Miss Adgate's father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; said Bertram, his eyebrows going up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wheels within wheels,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Miss Adgate's father was a
      mysterious American who, for reasons of his own, had left his country, and
      never went back. He never went to his embassy, either: you can make what
      you will of that. And even in Europe he had no settled abode; he lived in
      hotels; he was always flitting&mdash;London,&mdash;Paris, Rome, Vienna.
      And wherever he went, though he knew no one else, he knew troops of young
      men&mdash;<i>young</i> men, mark, and young men with expectations. He
      wasn't received at his embassy; he wasn't received in a single decent
      house; he was an utter outcast and pariah; but he always managed to
      surround himself with troops of young men who had expectations. He was
      nothing more or less, in short, than a money-lender. Yes, your
      'nice-looking' girl with the face full of high qualities, whom you think
      incapable of low ambitions, is just the daughter of a common money-lender&mdash;nothing
      better than that. And Henry Pontycroft was one of his victims. This, of
      course, was while Pontycroft was poor&mdash;while his rich cousin was
      alive and flourishing. And then, when the old usurer had him completely in
      his toils, he proposed a compact. If Pontycroft would exert his social
      influence on behalf of his daughter, and get her accepted in the right
      circles, Adgate would forgive him his debt, and pay him handsomely into
      the bargain. The next one knew, Miss Adgate was living with Lucilla Dor,
      like a member of the family, and Lucilla was beginning to spend money. Not
      long afterwards old Adgate died, and his daughter came into his millions.
      And so the ball goes on. They haven't ensnared a Duke for her yet, but
      that will only be a question of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton tilted her head a little to one side, and smiled at poor
      Bertram with the smile, satisfied yet benevolent, of one who had
      successfully brought off a promised feat&mdash;a smile of friendly
      challenge to criticise or reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bertram had his reply ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A compact,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can any human being have any knowledge of such
      a compact, except the parties to it? Besides, <i>I</i> know Harry
      Pontycroft&mdash;I've known him for years, intimately. He would be utterly
      incapable of such a thing. Sell his 'social influence' for money? Worse
      still, sell his sister's? Old Adgate may have been a moneylender, and
      Harry Pontycroft may have owed him money. But to get out of it by a
      proceeding so ignoble as that&mdash;his character is the negation of the
      very idea. And then, a titled husband! Surely, a girl of Miss Adgate's
      beauty and wealth would need little assistance in finding one, if she
      really cared about it. And anyhow, to act as her matrimonial agent&mdash;that
      again is a thing of which Harry Pontycroft would be incapable. But, for
      my part, I can't believe that Miss Adgate has any such desire. She looks
      to me like a young woman of mind and heart, with ideas and ideals, who
      would either marry for love pure and simple, or not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor's lips compressed themselves&mdash;but failed to hide her
      amusement. &ldquo;Oh, looks!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ideas, ideals? What do we know of the
      ideas and ideals of those queer people? Shylock's daughter. You may be
      sure that whatever their ideals may be, they're very different from any
      we're familiar with. A young woman who never had a <i>home</i>, whose
      childhood was passed in <i>hotels</i>.&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bertram, &ldquo;that's sad to think of. But Shylock's daughter&mdash;even
      Shylock's daughter married for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come to that,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton answered him, &ldquo;it's as easy to love
      a peer as a peasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye,&rdquo; questioned Bertram, thinking of Lewis Vincent, &ldquo;if the
      Pontycrofts are really as mercenary as all this would show them to be, why
      doesn't Ponty marry her himself? He's not a peer, to be sure, but in
      England the headships of some of your ancient untitled families almost
      outrank peerages, do they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton's face resumed its look of mystery. &ldquo;Henry Pontycroft would
      be only too glad to marry her&mdash;if he could,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
      alack-a-day for him, he can't, and for the best of reasons. He is already
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram stared, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pontycroft <i>married?</i>&rdquo; he doubted, his voice falling. &ldquo;But since
      when? It must be very recent&mdash;and it's astonishing I shouldn't have
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, anything but recent,&rdquo; Mrs. Wilberton returned, a kind of high
      impersonal pathos in her tone; &ldquo;and very few people know about it. But
      it's perfectly true&mdash;I have it on the best authority. When he was
      quite a young man, when he was still an undergraduate, he made a secret
      marriage&mdash;with some low person&mdash;a barmaid or music-hall singer
      or something. He hasn't lived with her for years&mdash;it seems she drank,
      and was flagrantly immoral, and had, in short, all the vices of her class&mdash;and
      most people have supposed him to be a bachelor. But there his wife
      remains, you see, a hopeless impediment to his marrying the Adgate
      millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is astounding news to me,&rdquo; said Bertram, with the subdued manner of
      one who couldn't deny that his adversary had scored. But then, cheering up
      a little, &ldquo;Why doesn't he poison her?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Or, better still,
      divorce her? In a country like England, where divorce is easy, why doesn't
      he divorce her, and so be free to marry whom he will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton gave him a glance of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought you knew,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The Pontycrofts are Roman
      Catholics&mdash;one of the handful of families in England who have never
      recanted their Popish errors. But I beg your pardon&mdash;you are a Roman
      Catholic yourself? Of course. Well, surely, your Church doesn't permit
      divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed, mirthlessly, grimly even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is an odd confounding of scruples,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A man is low enough to
      take a girl's money for acting as her social tout, but too pious to
      divorce a woman who must be the curse of his existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Wilberton, not without a semblance of pride in the
      circumstance, &ldquo;our English Roman Catholics are very strict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed,&rdquo; said Bertram, playing with his watch-chain, &ldquo;that you bowed
      very pleasantly when they passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton raised her hands. &ldquo;I'm not a prig,&rdquo; she earnestly
      protested. &ldquo;Don't think I'm a prig. This thing is known, but it's not
      official. In England until a thing becomes official, until it gets into
      the law-courts, we treat it, for all practical purposes, as if it didn't
      exist. Of course, I bowed to them.... Lucilla Dor, besides being a
      Pontycroft, is a leader in the most exclusive set; and Miss Adgate,
      officially, is simply her friend and protégée. And it isn't as if they
      were the only persons about whom ugly tales are told. If one began cutting
      one's acquaintances on that score, I don't know where one could stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugly tales,&rdquo; said Bertram, &ldquo;yes. But this particular ugly tale&mdash;upon
      my word I can't see a single reason why it should be believed. The only
      scrap of evidence in support of it, as far as I can make out, is the fact
      that Lady Dor has a motor-car and a few furs and diamonds. Well, she has
      also a rich and generous brother. No: I will stake Miss Adgate's face and
      Harry Pontycroft's honour against all the ugly tales that Gath and
      Ashkelon between them can produce. I don't believe it, I don't believe it,
      and I can only wonder that you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wilberton was gathering herself together, evidently with a view to
      departure. Now she rose, and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Prince,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;I must congratulate you upon your
      faith in human nature. In a man who has seen so much of the world, such an
      absence of cynicism is beautiful. I feel quite as if I had been playing
      the part of&mdash;what do you call him?&mdash;the Devil's Advocate. But&rdquo;&mdash;she
      nodded gravely, though perhaps there was a tinge of amusement in her
      gravity&mdash;&ldquo;in this case I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid that your
      charity is mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      When he came back from having conducted her to the waterside, he was
      followed by Balzatore and Rampicante. Rampicante leaped upon his shoulder,
      rubbed his bristly moustaches approvingly against his cheek, curled his
      tail about his collar, and, sublimely indifferent to any one's mood but
      his own, purred an egoist's satisfaction. Balzatore sat down before him,
      resting his long pointed muzzle on his knee and looked up into his face
      from alert, troubled, wistful eyes. &ldquo;What is the matter? What is it that's
      worrying you?&rdquo; they asked. For Balzatore knew that his master was not
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, his master was not happy. All round him were the light, the lucent
      colour, the shimmering warmth of Venice in early autumn, woven together in
      a transparent screen of beauty. The palaces opposite glowed pale gold,
      pale rose, pale amethyst, in the sun; the water below was dull blue-green
      and glassy, shot with changing reds and purples, like dark
      mother-of-pearl; the sky above was like blue-royal velvet; and where he
      sat, on his marble balcony, amid its ancient, time-worn carvings and
      traceries, all was cool blue shadow. But I doubt if he saw any of these
      things. What he saw was the face of Ruth Adgate, that odd, pretty, witty,
      frank, clear face of hers, those clear frank eyes, with their glint of
      red, their hint of inner laughter. He saw also the brown, lined, bony,
      good-humoured, clever, wholesome face of Harry Pontycroft, and the fair,
      soft, friendly face of Ponty's sister. The charge against these people was
      very trifling, if you will: it implied no devastating moral turpitude, but
      it was more ignominious than far graver charges might have been: it
      implied such petty aims, such sordid doings. To buy &ldquo;social influence&rdquo;&mdash;to
      sell services that should in their nature be the spontaneous offerings of
      kindness,&mdash;frequently indeed as one had heard of this branch of
      commerce, what, when it came to an actual transaction, could be on the
      part of buyer and seller more contemptible? Bertram vowed in his soul,
      &ldquo;No, I don't believe it, I won't believe it.&rdquo; And yet, for all his firm
      unfaith, he was not happy. A feeling of malaise, of disgust, almost of
      physical nausea, possessed him. Oh, why was every one so eager to rub the
      bloom from the peach? &ldquo;The worst of it is that Mrs. Wilberton is not a
      malicious woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She's worldly, frivolous, superficial,
      anything you like, but not malicious. If one could only dispose of her as
      malicious, her words wouldn't stick.&rdquo; And again, by and by, &ldquo;After all,
      it's none of my business,&mdash;why should I take it to heart?&rdquo; But
      somehow he did take it to heart; so that, at last, &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I
      must go out and walk it off&mdash;I must get rid of the nasty taste of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out to walk it off, Balzatore scouting a zig-zag course before
      him, down narrow alleys, over slender bridges. He went out to walk it off,
      and he walked into the very arms of it. In the multitude of wayfarers&mdash;beggars,
      hawkers, soldiers, priests, and citizens; English tourists, their noses in
      Baedeker, Dalmatian sailors, piratical-looking, swartskinned, wearing
      their crimson fezes at an angle that seemed a menace; bare-legged boys,
      bare-headed girls (sometimes with hair of the proper Venetian red); women
      in hats, and women in mantillas&mdash;in the vociferous, many-hued
      multitude that thronged the Mercerie, he met Stuart Seton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know Stuart Seton? He is a small, softly-built, soft-featured,
      pale, kittenish-looking man, with softly-curling hair and a soft little
      moustache, with a soft voice and soft languorous manners. A woman's man,
      you guess at your first glimpse of him, a women's pet; a man whom women
      will fondle and coddle, and send on errands, and laugh at to his face, and
      praise to other men; a man, for he has the unhallowed habit of using
      scent, who actually seems to smell of boudoirs. Bertram did not like him,
      and now, at their conjunction, stiffened instantly, from the fellow
      mortal, into the great personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on my way to call on you,&rdquo; said Seton, softly, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unfortunate in not being at home,&rdquo; returned Bertram, erect, aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to get you to give me an evening to dine,&rdquo; Seton explained. &ldquo;I
      am at the Britannia, and I have some friends there I'd like to present to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Bertram, his head very much in the air. &ldquo;Who are your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two,&rdquo; said Seton. &ldquo;One is Lady Dor, a charming woman, sister of
      Harry Pontycroft, and the other is Pontycroft's Faithful John&mdash;a very
      amusing gel named Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faithful John? The phrase was novel to Bertram, and struck him as
      unpleasant. &ldquo;Pontycroft's <i>what?</i>&rdquo; he asked, rather brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drawled Seton, undisturbed. &ldquo;It's quite the joke of the period, in
      England. She is one of those preposterously rich Americans, you know,&mdash;hundred
      and fifty thousand a year, and that sort of thing. Pooty too, and clever,
      with a sense of humour. But she's gone and fallen desperately in love with
      poor old Harry Pontycroft, and when he's present, upon my word, she eyes
      him exactly as a hungry dog eyes a bone. Which must make him feel a trifle
      queerish, seeing that he's twenty years her senior, and by no means a
      beauty, and not at all in the marrying line. If he were, you can trust the
      British mamma to have snapped him up long before this. So she worships him
      from afar with a hopeless, undying flame. Poor old Ponty! Most fellows, of
      course, would think themselves in luck, but Ponty has all the tin he knows
      what to do with, and a wife would suit his book about as well as a tame
      white elephant. He is dog-in-the-manger in spite of himself. No others
      need apply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram passed his hands across his brow, asking the spirits of the air, I
      daresay, where is truth? He passed his hand across his brow, while his
      lips uttered a kind of guttural and enigmatic <i>Mumph.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Newhampton, for instance,&rdquo; Seton complacently babbled on, &ldquo;the
      little Duke. Of course, with her supplies, she's had more or less the
      whole unmarried peerage after her, to pick and choose from; but she never
      turned a hair till Newhampton offered himself. Then she regularly broke
      down, and blew the gaff. A Duke! Well, a Duke's a Duke, and human nature
      couldn't stand it. She told him with tears in her eyes that he'd given her
      the hardest day's work she'd ever had to do. For I'd marry you like a
      shot, she said, only I'm unlucky enough to be in love with another man.
      Pontycroft for a fiver, said Newhampton, who's not such a fool as he
      looks. And, by Jove, if she didn't coolly up and tell him he was right!
      But the fun of it is that meantime Ponty's sister comes in for the
      reversion. If not the rose, she's near the rose, and she gets the golden
      dew. A private portable millionaire, who loves you for your brother and
      never shies at a bill, is a jolly convenient addition to a Christian
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram said nothing. He stood looking down the exiguous thoroughfare,
      over the heads of the passers-by, a cloud of preoccupation on his brow.
      Lewis Vincent, Mrs. Wilberton, and now this little cad of a Seton&mdash;three
      witnesses. But where was truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; the little cad, never scenting danger, in a minute went blandly
      on, &ldquo;I hope you'll give me an evening. Miss Adgate is sure to amuse you,
      and Lady Dor is a person you really ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Bertram, deliberately weighting his rudeness with a
      ceremonious bow, &ldquo;I don't think I should care to make their acquaintance
      under your auspices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And therewith he resumed his interrupted walk, leaving Seton,
      open-mouthed, roundeyed, to the enjoyment of a fine view of his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and bye, having (to cool his anger) marched twice round the Piazza, he
      entered San Marco, bidding Balzatore await his return outside. In the
      sombre loveliness of one of the chapels a rosary was being said. Among the
      score or so of women kneeling there, he saw, with a strange jump of the
      heart, Ruth Adgate and Lady Dor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned hastily away, not to spy upon their devotions. But what he had
      seen somehow restored the natural sweetness of things. And the vision of a
      delicate head bowed in prayer accompanied him home.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ONTYCROFT was
      really, as men go, a tallish man,&mdash;above, at any rate, what they call
      the medium height,&mdash;say five feet ten or eleven. But seated, like a
      Turk or a tailor&mdash;as he was seated now on the lawn of Villa Santa
      Cecilia, and as it was very much his ridiculous custom to sit,&mdash;with
      his head sunk forward and his legs curled up beneath him, making a mere
      torso of himself, he left you rather with an impression of him as short.
      That same sunken head, by the by, was a somewhat noticeable head;
      noticeably big; covered by a thick growth, close-cropped, of fawn-coloured
      hair; broad, with heavy bumps over the thick fawn-coloured eyebrows; the
      forehead traversed by many wrinkles, vertical and horizontal, deep almost
      as if they had been scored with a knife. It was a white forehead, but the
      face below, abruptly from the hat-line, was as brown as sun and open air
      could burn it, red-brown and lean, showing its sub-structure of bone: not
      by any means a handsome face; nay, with its short nose, perilously near a
      snub, its forward-thrust chin, deeply-cleft in the middle, its big mouth
      and the short fawn-coloured moustache that bristled on the lip, decidedly
      a plain face; yet decidedly too, somehow, a distinguished, very decidedly
      a pleasing face&mdash;shrewd, humorous, friendly; capable, trustworthy&mdash;lighted
      by grey eyes that seemed always to be smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were certainly smiling at this moment, as he looked off towards
      Florence, (where it lay under a thin drift of pearl-dust in the sun-filled
      valley), and spoke in his smiling masculine voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up at the villa&mdash;down in the city,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never <i>could</i>
      sympathise with that Italian person of quality. Surely, it's a thousand
      times jollier to be up at the villa. Then one can look down upon the city,
      and admire it as a feature of the landscape, and thank goodness one isn't
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's eyes (with the red glint in them) laughed at him. She sat leaning
      back on a rustic bench, a few yards away, under a mighty ilex. She wore a
      frock of pale green muslin, and her garden-hat had fallen on the ground
      beside her, so that what breeze there was could make free with her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not an Italian person of quality, you see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are a
      beef-eating Britisher, and retain a barbaric fondness for the greenwood
      tree. You are like Peter Bell, who never felt the witchery of the soft
      blue sky. You have never felt the witchery of brick and mortar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft, puffing his cigarette, regarded her through the smoke with a
      feint of thoughtful curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst thing about the young people of your generation,&rdquo; he remarked,
      assuming the tone of one criticising from an altitude, &ldquo;is that you have
      no conversation. Talk, among you, consists exclusively of personalities&mdash;gossip
      or chaff. Now, I was on the point of drawing a really rather neat little
      philosophical analogy; and you, instead of playing flint to steel, instead
      of encouraging me with a show of intelligent interest, check my
      inspiration with idle, personal chaff. Still, hatless young girls in
      greenery-whitery frocks, if they have plenty of reddish hair, add a very
      effective note to the foreground of a garden; and I suppose one should be
      content with them as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth ostentatiously &ldquo;composed a face,&rdquo; bending her head at the angle of
      intentness, lifting her eyebrows, making her eyes big and rapt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, taking a deep breath, &ldquo;I hope <i>that</i> is a show of
      intelligent interest. Let me hear your really rather neat little
      philosophical analogy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, with a melancholy shake of the head, &ldquo;that is only
      a show of the irreverence of youth for age. What is the fun of my being a
      hundred years your elder, if you are not to treat me with proportionate
      respect? And as for my analogy (which, perhaps, on second thoughts, is not
      so neat as I fancied), if I give it utterance, I shall do so simply for
      the sake of clarifying it to myself. It has reference to the everlasting
      problem of evil. Human life is like a city; and a city seen from a
      distance&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his cigarette towards Florence&mdash;&ldquo;is like
      human life taken as a whole. Taken piecemeal, bit by bit, as it passes,
      life dismays us, and terribly tries our faith, by the Evil it presents:
      the pain, disease, foul play, inequalities, injustices, what you will:
      just as a city, when we are in its streets, revolts us with its dirt,
      decay, squalor, stagnant air, noise, confusion, and its sordid population.
      But just as the city seen from a distance, just as Florence seen from
      here, loses all its piecemeal ugliness, and melts into a beautiful and
      harmonious unity, so human life viewed as a whole.... Well, you have my
      analogy&mdash;which, perhaps, after all, is really rather banal. Ah me, I
      wish I could marry you off. Why do you so systematically refuse all the
      brilliant offers that I so tirelessly contrive for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ruth seemed not to have heard his question, though he underlined it by
      looking up at her with a frown of grave anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately for us human beings,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no one has yet invented a
      process by which we can <i>live</i> our life as a whole. It's all very
      well to talk of viewing it, but we have to <i>live</i> it; and we have to
      live it piecemeal, bit by bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; demanded Pontycroft, cheerfully inconsequent, &ldquo;what can we ask
      better? Given health, wealth, and a little wisdom, it's extremely pleasant
      to live our life piecemeal. It's extremely pleasant to take it bit by bit,
      when the bits are sweet. And what, for instance, could be a sweeter bit
      than this?&rdquo; His lean brown hand described a comprehensive circle. &ldquo;A
      bright, crisp, cool, warm September morning; a big beautiful garden, full
      of fragrant airs; Italian sunshine, and the shade of ilexes; oleanders in
      blossom; cool turf to lie on, and a fountain tinkling cool music near at
      hand; then, beyond there, certainly the loveliest prospect in the world to
      feed our eyes&mdash;Val d'Arno, with its olive-covered hills, its
      cypresses, its white-walled villas, and Florence shining like a cut gem in
      the midst. Add good tobacco to smoke, and a simple child in white-green
      muslin, with plenty of reddish hair, to try one's analogies upon. What
      could man wish better? Why don't you get married? Why do you so perversely
      reject all the eligible suitors that I trot out for your inspection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's eyes laughed at him again. It was a laugh of frank amusement, but I
      think there was something dangerous in it too, a quick flash of mockery,
      even of menace and defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the train there is a swain I dearly lo' mysel',&rdquo; she lightly sang,
      her head thrown back. &ldquo;But you've never trotted <i>him</i> out. I don't
      get married'&mdash;detestable expression&mdash;because the only man I've
      ever seriously cared for has never asked me.&rdquo; She sighed&mdash;regretfully,
      resignedly; and made him a comical little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft studied her for a moment. Then, &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;A good job,
      too. I wasn't aware that you'd ever seriously cared for any one; but if
      you have&mdash;believe me, he's the last man living you should think of
      tying up with. The people we care for in our calf-period are always the
      wrong people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Calf-period? How pretty&mdash;but how sadly
      misapplied. I'm twenty-four years old. Besides, the person I care for is
      the right person, the rightest of all right persons, absolutely the one
      rightest person in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Pontycroft asked carelessly, lighting a fresh cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still again Ruth's eyes laughed at him. &ldquo;What's his name and where's his
      hame I dinna care to tell,&rdquo; again she sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Pontycroft, blowing the subject from him in a whiff of smoke.
      &ldquo;He's a baseless fabrication. He's a herring you've just invented to draw
      across the trail of my inquiries. But even if he were authentic, he
      wouldn't matter, since he's well-advised enough not to sue for your hand.
      Have you ever heard of a man called Bertrando Bertrandoni?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertrando Bertrandoni&mdash;Phoebus! what a name!&rdquo; laughed Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented Pontycroft, &ldquo;it's a trifle cumbrous, also perhaps a trifle
      flamboyant. So his English friends (he was educated in England, and you'd
      never know he wasn't English) have docked it to simple Bertram. Have you
      ever heard of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; said Ruth, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet he's a pretty well-known man,&rdquo; said Pontycroft. &ldquo;He writes&mdash;every
      now and then you'll see an article of his in one of the reviews. He
      paints, too&mdash;you'll see his pictures at the Salon; and plays the
      fiddle, and sings. A jack-of-many-trades, but, by exception, really rather
      a dab at 'em all. A sportsman besides&mdash;goes in for yachtin', huntin',
      fencin'. But over and above all that, a thorough good sort and a most
      amusing companion&mdash;a fellow who can talk, a fellow who's curious
      about things. Finally, a Serene and Semi-Royal Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; questioned Ruth, wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, &ldquo;you prick up your pretty ears. Yes, a Serene and
      Semi-Royal Highness. Has it ever struck you how chuckle-headed&mdash;saving
      their respect&mdash;our ancestors were? I suppose they drank the wrong
      sort of tea. Anyhow, they were mistaken about nearly everything, and most
      of their mistakes they elevated to the dignity of maxims. Now, for
      example, they had a maxim about Silence being golden, and another about
      Curiosity being a vice. It's pitiful to think of the enormous number of
      more or less tedious anecdotes they laboriously imagined to illustrate and
      enforce those two profound untruths. Silence golden? My dear, silence is
      simply piggish. Your silent man is simply a monstrous Egotist, who, in
      what should be the reciprocal game of conversation, takes without giving&mdash;allows
      himself to be entertained, perhaps enriched, at his interlocuter's
      expense, and is too soddenly self-complacent to feel that he owes anything
      in return. Oh, I know, you'll plead shyness for him&mdash;you'll tell me
      he doesn't speak because he's shy. In a certain number of cases, I grant,
      that is the fact. But what then? Why, shyness is Egotism multiplied by
      itself. Your shy person is a person so sublimely (or infernally) conscious
      of his own existence and his own importance, so penetrated by the
      conviction that he is the centre of the Universe and that all eyes are
      fixed upon him, and therewith so concerned about the effect he may
      produce, the figure he may cut, that he dare not move lest he shouldn't
      produce an heroic effect or cut an Olympian figure. And then, curiosity! A
      vice? Look here. You are born, with eyes, ears, and a brain, into a world
      that God created. You have eyes, ears, and a brain, and all round you is a
      world that God created&mdash;and yet you are not curious about it. A world
      that God created, and that man, your duplicate man, lives in; a world in
      which everything counts, small things as well as big things&mdash;the
      farthest planet and the trifling-est affair of your next-door neighbour,
      the course of Empire and the price of figs. But no&mdash;God's world,
      man's life&mdash;they leave you cold, they fail to interest you; you
      glance indifferently at them, they hardly seem worth your serious
      attention, you shrug and turn away. 'Tis a world that God created, and you
      treat it as if it were a child's mud-pie! Good heavens! And the worst of
      it is that the people who do that are mightily proud of themselves in
      their smug fashion. Curiosity is a vice and a weakness; they are above it.
      My sweet child, no single good thing has ever happened to mankind, no
      single forward step has ever been taken in what they call human progress,
      but it has been primarily due to some one's 'curiosity.'&rdquo; He brought the
      word out with a flourish, making it big. Then he lay back, and puffed hard
      at his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; urged Ruth demurely. &ldquo;Please don't stop. I like half-truths, and
      as for quarter-truths, I perfectly adore them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, &ldquo;is a fellow who can talk, and a fellow who's
      curious about things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she reflected, as one trying to fit
      together incompatible ideas, &ldquo;I think you let fall something about his
      being a Serene and Semi-Royal Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; Pontycroft instructed her, &ldquo;there are intelligent individuals
      in all walks of life. There are intelligent princes, there are even
      intelligent scientific persons. The Bertrandoni are the legitimate
      grand-dukes of Altronde, the old original dynasty. They were 'hurled from
      the throne,' I don't know how many years ago, in a revolution, and the
      actual reigning family, the Ceresini, have been in possession ever since.
      But Bertram's father is the Pretender. He calls himself the Duke of
      Oltramare, and lives in Paris&mdash;lives there, I grieve to state, in the
      full Parisian sense&mdash;is a professed <i>viveur</i>. I met him once, a
      handsome old boy, military-looking, red-faced, with a white moustache and
      imperial, and a genially wicked eye. Anyhow, there's one thing to his
      credit&mdash;he had Bertram educated at Harrow and Cambridge, instead of
      at one of these soul-destroying Continental universities. He and his
      Duchess never meet. She and Bertram are supposed to live in Venice, at the
      palace of the family, Cà Bertrandoni, though as a matter of fact you'll
      rarely find either of them at home. She spends most of her time in
      Austria, where she was born&mdash;a Wohenhoffen, if you please; there's no
      better blood. And Bertram is generally at the other end of the earth&mdash;familiarizing
      himself with the domestic manners of the Annamites, or the religious
      practices of the Patagonians. However, I believe lately he's dropped that
      sort of thing&mdash;given up travelling and settled down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is palpitatingly interesting,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Is it all apropos of
      boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft put on his hat, and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's apropos,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;of your immortal welfare. I had a note from
      Bertram this morning to say he was in Florence, no farther away than that.
      I'm going down now to call on him, and I'll probably bring him back to
      luncheon. So tell Lucilla to have a plate laid for him. Also put on your
      best bib and tucker, and try to behave as nicely as you can. For if you
      should impress him favourably.... Ah me, I wish I could marry you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me, I wish you could&mdash;to the man I care for,&rdquo; responded Ruth,
      with dreamy eyes, and wistfulness real or feigned.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have already met them, your sister and Miss Adgate,&rdquo; Bertram
      announced, with an occult little laugh. Pontycroft looked his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? They've kept precious mum about it. When? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other day at Venice,&rdquo; Bertram laughed. &ldquo;I even had the honour of
      escorting them to their hotel in my gondola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft's face bespoke sudden enlightenment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Then you're the mysterious stranger who came to their
      rescue when they were benighted at the Lido. They've told me about that.
      And oh, the quantities of brain-tissue they've expended wondering who you
      were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; asked Pontycroft, the wrinkles of his brow tied into puzzled
      knots, &ldquo;how did you know who <i>they</i> were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them the next day when I was at the Florian with Lewis Vincent, and
      he told me,&rdquo; Bertram explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft laughed, deeply, silently. &ldquo;Thank Providence I shall be present
      at the scene that's coming. The man of the family brings a friend home to
      luncheon, and lo, the ladies recognise in him their gallant rescuer. It's
      amazing how Real Life rushes in where Fiction fears to tread. That scene
      is one which has been banished from literature these thirty years, which
      no playwright or novelist would dare to touch; yet here is Real Life
      blithely serving it up to us as if it were quite fresh. It's another
      instance&mdash;and every one has seen a hundred&mdash;of Real Life
      sedulously apeing ill-constructed and unconvincing melodrama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram, leaning on the window-sill, and looking down at the yellow flood
      of the Arno, again softly chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but in this case I'm afraid Real Life has received a
      little adventitious encouragement.&rdquo; He turned back into the room, the
      stiff hotel sitting-room, with its gilt-and-ebony furniture, its
      maroon-and-orange hangings. &ldquo;The truth is that I've come to Florence for
      the especial purpose of seeing you&mdash;and of seeking this
      introduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; murmured Ponty, bowing. &ldquo;So much the better, then,&rdquo; he approved.
      &ldquo;Though I beg to observe,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that this doesn't elucidate the
      darker mystery&mdash;how you knew that we were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; laughed Bertram, &ldquo;the unsleeping vigilance of the Press. Your
      movements are watched and chronicled. There was a paragraph in the <i>Anglo-Italian
      Times</i>. It fell under my eye the day before yesterday, and&mdash;well,
      you see whether I have let the grass grow. My glimpse of the ladies was
      extremely brief, but it was enough to make me very keen to meet them
      again. After all, I have a kind of prescriptive right to know Lady Dor&mdash;isn't
      she the sister of one of my oldest friends? Miss Adgate,&rdquo; he spoke with
      respectful hesitancy, &ldquo;I think I have heard, is an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of sorts&mdash;yes,&rdquo; Ponty answered. &ldquo;But without the feathers. Her
      father was a New Englander, who came to Europe on the death of his wife,
      when Ruth was three years old, and never went back. So she's entirely a
      European product.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His smiling eyes studied for a moment the flowers and clouds and cupids
      painted in blue and pink upon the ceiling. Then his theme swept him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a very remarkable man, her father. I think he had the widest, the
      most all-round culture of any man I've ever known; he was beyond question
      the most brilliant talker. And he was wonderful to look at, with a great
      old head and a splendid tangle of hair and beard. He was a man who could
      have distinguished himself ten times over, if he would only have <i>done</i>
      things&mdash;written books, or what not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he positively didn't know what ambition meant; he hadn't a trace of
      vanity, of the desire to shine, in his whole composition. Therefore he did
      nothing&mdash;except absorb knowledge, and delight his friends with his
      magnificent talk. He made me the executor of his will, and when he died it
      turned out that he was vastly richer than any one had thought.. Twenty odd
      years before, he had taken some wild land in Wyoming for a bad debt, and
      meanwhile the city of Agamenon had been obliging enough to spring up upon
      it. So, when Ruth attained her majority, I was able to hand over to her a
      fortune of about thirty thousand a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Bertram, and thought of Mrs. Wilberton. This rhymed
      somewhat faultily with the story of a money-lender. Then, while
      Pontycroft, his legs curled up, sat on the maroon-and-orange sofa, and
      puffed his eternal cigarette, Bertram took a turn or two about the room.
      He didn't want to ask questions; he didn't want to seem to pry. But he did
      want to hear just as much about Ruth Adgate as Pontycroft might be
      inclined to tell. He didn't want to ask questions, and yet, after a
      minute, as Pontycroft simply smoked in silence, he ended by asking one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Miss Adgate is of the Old Religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;her father was a convert, and a mighty fervent and eloquent
      one, too,&rdquo; Ponty replied nowise loth to pursue the subject. &ldquo;That was what
      first brought us together. We were staying at the same inn in one of the
      Protestant cantons of Switzerland, and on Sunday morning all three of us
      tramped off nine miles to hear Mass, Ruth being then about ten. He was a
      man who never went in for general society. He never went in for anything
      usual or conventional. His life was extraordinarily detached. But he had
      his own little group of friends, of old cronies and young disciples, in
      pretty nearly every town of Europe, so that he never needed to be lonely.
      And he had a brother, an elder brother, whom he was always going out to
      America to see; General Adgate, United States Army, retired, residing at
      Oldbridge, Connecticut. Every spring, every summer, every autumn, old Tom
      Adgate made his plans to go and visit the General, and then he put the
      visit off. I think he'd never really got over his grief for the death of
      his wife, and that he dreaded returning to the places that were associated
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram did not want to ask questions&mdash;yet now he asked another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Miss Adgate herself&mdash;has she never been to America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she won't go,&rdquo; Pontycroft said. &ldquo;We've urged her, pressed her to go,
      Lucilla and I&mdash;not to stop, of course&mdash;but to see the place, to
      <i>faire acte de presence</i>. Lucilla has even offered to go with her.
      And the General has written fifty times begging her to come and stay with
      him at Oldbridge. She really ought to go. It's her native country, and she
      ought to make its acquaintance. But she seems to have imbibed a prejudice
      against it. She's been unfortunate in getting hold of some rather terrible
      American newspapers, printed in all the colours of the rainbow, in which
      the London correspondents made her and her affairs the subject of their
      prose. And then she's read some American novels. I'm bound to confess that
      I can understand her shrinking a bit, if American society is anything like
      what American novelists depict. The people seem entirely to lack manners,&mdash;and
      the novelists seem ingenuously oblivious of the deficiency. They present
      the most unmitigated bounders, and appear in all good faith to suppose
      they are presenting gentlemen and ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bertram, smiling, &ldquo;one has noticed that.&rdquo; Then,
      thoughtful-eyed, pacing the floor, the world-traveller spoke: &ldquo;But America
      is very big, and very heterogeneous in its elements, and the novelists
      leave a good deal out. There's no such thing as American society,&mdash;there
      are innumerable different societies, unassimilated, unaffiliated, and one
      must pick and choose. Besides, Oldbridge&mdash;didn't you say&mdash;is in
      New England? New England is an extraordinary little world apart, as unlike
      the rest of the country as&mdash;as a rural dean is unlike a howling
      dervish. The rest of the country is in the making, a confusion of
      materials that don't match; New England is finished, completed; and of a
      piece. Take Boston, for instance,&mdash;I really don't know a more
      interesting town. It's pretty, it's even stately; it's full of colour and
      character; it's full of expression,&mdash;it expresses its race and its
      history. And as for society, Boston society is as thoroughbred as any I
      have ever encountered&mdash;easy, hospitable, with standards, with
      traditions, and at the same time with a faint breath of austerity, a
      little remainder of Puritanism, that is altogether surprising and amusing,
      and in its effect rather tonic. No, no, there's nothing to shrink from in
      New England&mdash;unless, perhaps, its winter climate. It can't be denied
      that they sometimes treat you to sixty degrees of frost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft blew a long stream of smoke, &ldquo;I'll ask you to repeat that
      sermon to Ruth herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram halted, guiltily hung his head. &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;my text
      ran away with me. But why doesn't&mdash;if Miss Adgate won't go to
      America, why doesn't America come to her? Why doesn't General Adgate come
      to Europe?&rdquo; Pontycroft's brows knotted themselves again. &ldquo;Ah, why indeed?&rdquo;
       he echoed. &ldquo;Hardly for want of being asked, at any rate. Ruth has asked
      him, my sister has asked him, I have asked him. And it seems a smallish
      enough thing to do. But in his way, I imagine he's as unlike other folk as
      his brother was in his. He's a bachelor&mdash;wedded, apparently, to his
      chimney-corner. There's no dislodging him&mdash;at least by the written
      word. So Ruth, you see, is rather peculiarly alone in the world, as I'm
      afraid she sometimes rather painfully feels. She has Lucilla and me, a
      kind of honorary sister and brother, and in England she has her old
      governess, Miss Nettleworth, a cousin of Charlie Nettleworth, who lives
      with her, and might be regarded as a stipendiary aunt. And that's all,
      unless you count heaps of acquaintances, and scores of wise youths who'd
      like to marry her. But she appears to have devoted herself to
      spinsterhood. One and all, she refuses 'em as fast as they come up. She's
      even refused a duke, which is accounted, I suppose, the most heroic thing
      a girl in England can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; said Bertram, in a tone that by no means disguised his
      eagerness to hear more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Newhampton,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;As he tells the story himself,
      there's no reason why I shouldn't repeat it. His people&mdash;mother and
      sister&mdash;had been at him for months to propose to her, and at last
      (they were staying in the same country house) he took her for a walk in
      the shrubberies and did his filial and fraternal duty. I'm not sure
      whether you know him? The story isn't so funny unless you do. He's a tiny
      little chap, only about six-and-twenty, beardless, rosy-gilled&mdash;looks
      for all the world like a boy fresh from Eton. 'By Jove, I thought my hour
      had struck,' says he. 'I'd no idea I should come out of it a free man.
      Well, it shows that honesty <i>is</i> the best policy, after all. I told
      her honestly that my heart was a burnt-out volcano&mdash;that I hoped I
      should make a kind and affectionate husband&mdash;but that I had had my <i>grande
      passion</i>, and could never love again; if she chose to accept me on that
      understanding&mdash;well, I was at her disposal. After which I stood and
      quaked, waiting for my doom. But she&mdash;she simply laughed. And then
      she said I was the honestest fellow she'd ever known, and had made the
      most original proposal she'd ever listened to, which she wouldn't have
      missed for anything; and to reward me for the pleasure I'd given her, she
      would let me off&mdash;decline my offer with thanks. Yes, by Jove, she
      regularly rejected me&mdash;me, a duke&mdash;with the result that we've
      been the best of friends ever since.' And so indeed they have,&rdquo; concluded
      Ponty with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed too&mdash;and thought of Stuart Seton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchess-mother, though,&rdquo; Ponty went on, &ldquo;was inconsolable&mdash;till
      I was fortunate enough to console her. I discovered that she had an
      immensely exaggerated notion of Ruth's wealth, and mentioned the right
      figures. 'Dear me,' she cried, 'in that case Ferdie has had a lucky
      escape. He surely shouldn't let himself go under double that.' But now&rdquo;&mdash;Ponty
      laughed again&mdash;&ldquo;observe how invincible is truth. There are plenty of
      people in England who'll tell you that they were actually engaged, and
      that when it came to settlements, finding she wasn't so rich as he'd
      supposed, Newhampton cried off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram had resumed his walk about the room. Presently, &ldquo;You know Stuart
      Seton, of course?&rdquo; he asked, coming to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of him?&rdquo; asked Bertram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A fine puss-gentleman that's all perfume,'&rdquo; Ponty laughed. &ldquo;Oh, he's a
      harmless enough little beast, but it's a pity he oils his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Bertram, with an air of profound thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponty looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he cried, starting up; &ldquo;it's time we were off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was, however, no such scene at Villa Santa Cecilia as the man of the
      family (I'm afraid with some malicious glee) had anticipated. The ladies
      indeed recognised in his friend their gallant rescuer, and no doubt
      experienced the appropriate emotions, but they made no violent
      demonstration of them. They laughed, and shook hands, and bade him
      welcome; Bertram laughed a good deal, too&mdash;you know how easily he
      laughs; and that was all. Then they went in to luncheon, during which
      meal, while the ball of conversation flew hither, thither, he could
      observe (and admire) Ruth Adgate to his heart's content: her slender
      figure, her oddly pretty face, her crinkling dark hair with its
      wine-coloured lights, her brown eyes with their red underglow, their
      covert laughter. &ldquo;High energies quiescent&rdquo;&mdash;his own first phrase came
      back to him. &ldquo;There's something tense in her&mdash;there's a spring&mdash;there's
      a tense chord. If it were touched&mdash;well, one feels how it could
      vibrate.&rdquo; A man, in other words, felt that here was a woman with womanhood
      in her. 'Tis a quality somewhat infrequently met with in women nowadays,
      and, for men, it has a singular interest and attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft, I am sorry to record it, behaved very badly at table. He began
      by stealing Ruth's bread; then he played balancing tricks&mdash;sufficiently
      ineffectual&mdash;with his knife and fork, announcing himself as <i>élève
      de Cinquevalli</i>; then, changing his title to <i>élève du regretté
      Sludge</i>, he produced a series of what he called spirit-rappings, though
      they sounded rather like the rappings of sole-leather against a
      chair-round; then he insisted on smoking cigarettes between the courses&mdash;&ldquo;after
      the high Spanish fashion,&rdquo; he explained; and finally, assuming the
      wheedling tone of a spoiled child, he pleaded to be allowed to have his
      fruit before the proper time. &ldquo;I want my fruit&mdash;mayn't I have my
      fruit? Ah, <i>please</i> let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, patience,&rdquo; said Lucilla, in her most soothing voice, with her
      benignant smile. &ldquo;Everything comes at last to him who knows how to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything comes at once to him who will not wait,&rdquo; Ponty brazenly
      retorted, and leaning forward, helped himself from the crystal dish, piled
      high with purple figs and scarlet africani.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the garden for coffee, and afterwards Ponty engaged his
      sister in a game of lawn-golf, leaving Ruth and Bertram to look on from
      the terrace, where Ruth sat among bright-hued cushions in a wicker chair,
      and Bertram (conscious of a pleasant agitation) leaned on the
      lichen-stained marble balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Lucilla,&rdquo; she said to him, the laughter in her eyes coming to the
      surface, &ldquo;she hates it, you know. But I suppose Harry honestly thinks it
      amuses her, and she's too good-natured to undeceive him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are red notes in her very voice,&rdquo; said Bertram to himself. &ldquo;Poor
      lady,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;'Tis her penalty for having an English brother. A
      game of one sort or another is an Englishman's sole conception of
      happiness. And that is the real explanation of Anglo-Saxon superiority.
      Englishmen take the most serious businesses of life as games&mdash;war,
      politics, commerce, literature, everything. It's that which keeps them
      sane and makes them successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth looked doubtful. &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon superiority?&rdquo; she questioned. &ldquo;Do you
      believe in Anglo-Saxon superiority? To be sure, we're always thanking
      Heaven that we're so much better than our neighbours; but apart from fond
      delusions, <i>are</i> we better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're at any rate fresher and lighter-hearted,&rdquo; Bertram asseverated.
      &ldquo;Englishmen always remain boys. We poor Continentals, especially we poor
      Latins, grow old and sad, or else sour, or else dry and hard. We take life
      either as a grand melodrama, or as a monotonous piece of prose; and it's
      all because we haven't your English way of taking it as a game&mdash;the
      saving spirit of sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth laughed a little. &ldquo;Yes, and a good many Englishwomen remain boys,
      too,&rdquo; she added musingly. &ldquo;How is that beautiful dog of yours?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;Have you brought him with you to Florence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Balzatore? No, I left him in Venice. He's rather a stickler for his
      creature-comforts, and the accommodations for dogs in Italian trains are
      not such as he approves of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth opened wide her eyes. &ldquo;Can they be worse than the accommodations for
      human beings?&rdquo; she wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can tell you,&rdquo; Bertram replied, &ldquo;is that I once took Balzatore with
      me to Padua, and he howled conscientiously the whole way. I have never
      known a human being (barring babies) to do that. They shut him in a kind
      of drawer, a kind of black hole, under the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brutes,&rdquo; said Ruth, with a shudder. &ldquo;Don't you rather admire our view?&rdquo;
       she asked, first glancing up at her companion, and then directing her gaze
      down the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There never <i>were</i> such eyes,&rdquo; said Bertram to himself. &ldquo;There never
      <i>was</i> such a view,&rdquo; he said to her. &ldquo;With the sky and the clouds and
      the sun&mdash;and the haze, like gold turned to vapour&mdash;and the
      purple domes and pinnacles of Florence. How is it possible for a town to
      be at the same time so lovely and so dull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth glanced up at him again. &ldquo;Is Florence <i>dull?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think so?&rdquo; he asked, smiling down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't know it very well,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The Ponte Vecchio
      seems fairly animated&mdash;and then there are always the Botticellis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say there are always the Botticellis,&rdquo; Bertram admitted, laughing.
      &ldquo;But the Ponte Vecchio doesn't count&mdash;the people there are all Jews.
      I was thinking of the Florentines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes; I see,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;They're chiefly retired Anglo-Indians,
      aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, isn't that,&rdquo; demanded Bertram, with livelier laughter, &ldquo;an entire
      concession of my point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you people so silent about?&rdquo; asked Pontycroft, coming up with
      Lucilla from the lawn. Lucilla sank with an ouf of thankfulness into one
      of the cushioned chairs. Ponty seated himself on the balustrade, near
      Bertram, and swung his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never play lawn-golf with Lucilla,&rdquo; he warned his listeners. &ldquo;She cheats
      like everything. She even poked a ball into a hole with her toe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good way of making it go in,&rdquo; Lucilla answered. &ldquo;Besides, if I
      cheated, it was for two good purposes: first, to hurry up the game, which
      would otherwise have lasted till I dropped; and then to show you how much
      more inventive and resourceful women are than men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fanned her soft face gently with her pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponty turned to Bertram. &ldquo;Tell us the latest secret tidings from Altronde.
      What are the prospects of the rightful party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, do tell us of Altronde,&rdquo; said Lucilla, dropping her handkerchief
      into her lap, and looking up with eagerness in her soft eyes. &ldquo;I've never
      met a Pretender before. Do tell us all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram laughed. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there's nothing about it. There are no
      tidings from Altronde, and the rightful party (if there is one) has no
      prospects. And I am not a Pretender&mdash;I am merely the son of a
      Pretender, and my father maintains his pretensions merely as a matter of
      form&mdash;not to let them, in a legal sense, lapse. He is as well aware
      as any one that there'll never be a restoration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Lucilla, her eyes darkening with disappointment; then, hope
      dying hard: &ldquo;But one constantly sees paragraphs in the papers headed
      'Unrest in Altronde,' and they seem to enjoy a change of ministry with
      each new moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Bertram, &ldquo;there's plenty of unrest&mdash;the people being
      exorbitant drinkers of coffee; and as every deputy aspires to be a
      minister in turn, they change their ministry as often as they have a
      leisure moment. 'Tis a state very much divided against itself. But there's
      one thing they're in a vast majority agreed upon, and that is that they
      don't want a return of the Bertrandoni.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you such dreadful tyrants?&rdquo; questioned Ruth, artlessly serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There spoke the free-born daughter of America,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid we were, rather,&rdquo; Bertram seriously answered her. &ldquo;If History
      speaks the truth, I'm afraid we rather led the country a dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that respect you couldn't have held a candle to your successors,&rdquo; put
      in Ponty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ceresini really are a handful. Let alone their extravagances, and
      their squabbles with their wives&mdash;I've seen Massimiliano
      staggering-drunk in the streets of his own capital. And then, if you drag
      in History, History never does speak truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marvel the people stand it,&rdquo; said Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't stand it for ever,&rdquo; said Bertram. &ldquo;Some day there'll be a
      revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;? But then&mdash;&mdash;? Won't your party come in?&rdquo;
       she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he predicted, &ldquo;after perhaps a little interregnum, during which
      they'll try a republic, Altronde will be noiselessly absorbed by the
      Kingdom of Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;History never speaks truth, and prophets (with the best will in the
      world) seldom do,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;Believe as much or as little of Bertram's
      vaticination as your fancy pleases. In a nation of hot-blooded Southrons
      like the Altrondesi, anything is possible. For my part, I shouldn't be
      surprised if their legitimate sovereign were recalled in triumph
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perish the thought,&rdquo; cried Bertram, throwing up his hand, &ldquo;unless you can
      provide a substitute to fill what would then become my highly
      uncomfortable situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was looking curiously at Pontycroft. &ldquo;What has History been doing,&rdquo;
       she inquired, &ldquo;to get into your bad graces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft turned towards her, and made a portentous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;History,&rdquo; he informed her in his deepest voice, &ldquo;is the medium in which
      lies are preserved for posterity, just as flies are preserved in amber.
      History consists of the opinions formed by fallible and often foolish
      literary men from the testimony of fallible, contradictory, often
      dishonest, and rarely dispassionate witnesses. The witnesses, either with
      malice aforethought, or because their faculties are untrained, see
      falsely, malobserve; then they make false, or at best, faulty records of
      their malobservations. A century later comes your Historian; studies these
      false, faulty, contradictory records; picks and chooses among 'em; forms
      an opinion, the character of which will be entirely determined by his own
      character&mdash;his temperament, prejudices, kind and degree of
      intelligence, and so forth; and finally publishes his opinion under the
      title of <i>The History of Ballywhack</i>. But the history, please to
      remark, remains nothing more nor less than an exposition of the private
      views of Mr. Jones. And please to remark further that no two histories of
      Ballywhack will be in the least agreement&mdash;except upon unessentials.
      So that if Mr. Jones's history is true, those of Messrs. Brown and
      Robinson must necessarily be false. No, no, no; if you go to seek Truth in
      the printed page, seek it in novels, seek it in poems, seek it in fairy
      tales or fashion papers, but don't waste your time seeking it in
      histories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the others greeted his peroration with some laughter, Pontycroft
      lighted a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I'd much rather seek it in fashion papers,&rdquo; drawled Lucilla.
      &ldquo;They're so much lighter and easier to hold than great heavy history
      books, and besides they sometimes really give one ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't, above all things,&rdquo; put in Ruth, &ldquo;seek it in a small volume
      which I am preparing for the press, and which is to be entitled, <i>The
      Paradoxes of Pontycroft.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Bertram walked back to Florence, down the steep, cobble-paved lanes,
      between the high villa walls, draped now with flowering cyclamen, while
      glimpses of the lily-city came and went before him, something like a
      phantom of Ruth Adgate floated by his side. Her voice was in his ears, the
      scent of her garments was in his nostrils; he saw her face, her eyes, her
      smiling red mouth, her fragile nervous body. &ldquo;I have never met a woman who&mdash;who
      moved me so&mdash;troubled me so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it possible that I am in
      love with her? Already?&rdquo; It seemed premature, it seemed unlikely; yet why
      couldn't he get her from his mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      Be thou chaste as ice, pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. He
      thought as he had thought again and again to-day, of Mrs. Wilberton. &ldquo;Just
      so certainly,&rdquo; he argued, &ldquo;as a woman is alone in the world, and young,
      and good-looking, just so certainly must slanderous tongues select her for
      their victim. Add wealth,&mdash;which trebles her conspicuousness,&mdash;which
      excites a thousand envies,&mdash;and&mdash;well, the Lord help her and
      those who profess themselves her friends. That exquisite young girl! Her
      fine old father was a moneylender, and she is paying the Pontycrofts to
      push her in society. Likely stories: Yet how are you to prevent people
      telling and believing them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands towards the blue empyrean, and let them fall heavily
      back beside him, as one summoning angels and archangels to mark the
      relentless logic of evil. And the nine peasants who just then rattled past
      him in a cart drawn by a single donkey, rolled their eyes, and muttered
      among themselves, &ldquo;Another mad Inglese.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh, ye Powers,&rdquo; he groaned, groaned in the silence of his spirit,
      while audibly he laughed with laughter that really was sardonic, &ldquo;if Ponty
      knew, if Ponty half suspected!&rdquo; Pontycroft was a man with magnificent
      capacities for anger. If Pontycroft should come to know, as any day he
      might, as some day he almost inevitably must,&mdash;it was not pleasant to
      picture the rage that would fill him. And would it not extend, that rage
      of his, &ldquo;to us, his friends,&rdquo; Bertram had to ask himself, &ldquo;for not having
      put him on his guard, for not having given him a hint?&rdquo; Alas, it almost
      certainly would. &ldquo;What! You, my friends, you heard the beastly things
      people were saying, and you never warned me&mdash;you left me in fatuous
      ignorance of them!&rdquo; Yes; bitter, scathing, would be Pontycroft's
      reproaches; and yet, and yet&mdash;Imagining a little the case of the man
      who should undertake to convey that warning, Bertram was conscious of a
      painful inward chill. &ldquo;It is not for me to do it&mdash;no, I should simply
      never have the courage.&rdquo; The solution of the whole difficulty, of course,
      would be her marriage. &ldquo;She should marry someone with a name and a
      position&mdash;a name and a position great enough in themselves to stifle
      scandal. If she should marry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Well, a Prince of the house of
      Bertrandoni, for example.... But he did not get so far as quite to say
      these words. At the mere dim adumbration of the idea, he stopped short,
      stood still, and waited for his nerves to cease tingling, his heart to
      pound less violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it conceivable that I am in love with a girl I've only seen twice in
      my life? And what manner of likelihood is there that she would have me?
      She refuses everyone, Ponty says; and that odious little Stuart Seton says
      she is in love with Ponty himself. No, I don't suppose I have the ghost of
      a chance. Still&mdash;still&mdash;she certainly didn't look or behave as
      if she was in love with Ponty; and that odious little Seton is just an
      odious little romancer; and as for her refusing everyone, <i>tant va la
      cruche à l'eau</i>&mdash;&mdash;! Anyhow, a man may try, a man may pay his
      court. And if&mdash;But, good Heavens, I am forgetting my mother. What
      would my mother say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were abundant reasons why the sudden recollection of his mother
      should give him pause. His mother was by no means simply the Duchess of
      Oltramare, the consort of the Pretender to a throne. She was something, to
      her own way of measuring, much greater than this: she was an Austrian and
      a Wohenhoffen. Mere Semi-Royal Bertrandoni, mere Dukes of Oltramare, mere
      Pretenders to the throne of Altronde, might marry whom they would;
      lineage, blood, quarterings, they might dispense with. But to a
      Wohenhoffen, to a noble of the noblesse of Austria, lineage, blood,
      quarterings were as essential as the breath of life. And Ruth Adgate was
      an American. And&mdash;have Americans quarterings? A daughter-in-law
      without them would, in all literalness, be less acceptable to his proud
      old Austrian Wohenhoffen of a mother, than a daughter-in-law without her
      five senses or without hands and feet; would be a thing, in fact,
      unthinkable. For people without quarterings, to the mind of your Austrian
      Wohenhoffens, constitute an entirely separate, not order, not estate, an
      entirely separate Race, an alien species, no more to be intermarried with
      than Esquimaux or Zulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there were plenty of reasons why the recollection of his mother
      should dash his soaring fancies. But fancies are stubborn things and by
      and bye they began anew to stir their pinions. True, his mother was an
      Austrian and a Wohenhoffen, yet at the same time she was the smiling
      embodiment of good-humour and good-nature, and she was the most sociable
      and the most susceptible soul alive,&mdash;she loved to be surrounded by
      amusing people, she formed the strongest friendships and attachments. If
      she were at Florence now, for example, and if the inhabitants of Villa
      Santa Cecilia were presented to her, she would take each of them to her
      heart. She would like Pontycroft, she would like Lucilla, above all she
      would like Ruth; she would like her for her youth and freshness, for her
      prettiness, for her gaiety, for everything. She would like her, too,
      because she was a Catholic, the Duchess of Oltramare being an exceedingly
      devout daughter of the Church. And it would never occur to her to ask
      whether she had quarterings or not&mdash;it would never occur to her that
      so nice a person could fail to have them. And then&mdash;and then, when
      the question of quarterings <i>did</i> arise&mdash;Well, even Austrians,
      even Wohenhoffens, might perhaps gradually be brought to accustom
      themselves to new ideas. And then&mdash;well, even to a Wohenhoffen, the
      fact that you possess a handsome fortune will by no means lessen your
      attractiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; cried this designing son, &ldquo;I'll write to my mother to-night,
      and ask her to come to Florence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of course, no sooner had Bertram left them, than Pontycroft turned to the
      ladies, and said, &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well what?&rdquo; teased Ruth, trying to look as if she didn't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, making a face at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's delightful,&rdquo; said Lucilla; &ldquo;so simple and unassuming, and unspoiled.
      And so romantic&mdash;like one of Daudet's <i>rois en exil</i>. And he has
      such nice eyes, and such a nice slim athletic figure. Do you think it's
      true that his people have no hope of coming to the throne? I've felt it in
      my bones that we should meet him again, ever since that night at the Lido.
      I knew it was all an act of Destiny. How wonderfully he speaks English&mdash;and
      thinks and feels it. He has quite the English point of view&mdash;he can
      see a joke. Oh, I've entirely lost my heart, and if I weren't restrained
      by a sense of my obligations as a married woman I should make the most
      frantic love to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth lay back in her chair, and shook her head, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your swans, your swans,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Disdain,&rdquo; said Ponty, regarding her with an eye that was meant
      to wither, &ldquo;it is better that a thousand geese should be mistaken for
      swans, than that a single swan should be mistaken for a goose. Oh, your
      geese, your geese!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lord Sententious,&rdquo; riposted Ruth, &ldquo;what is the good of making any
      mistake at all? Why not take swans for swans, geese for geese, and
      blameless little princelings for blameless little princelings? Yes, your
      little princeling seemed altogether blameless, an exceedingly
      well-meaning, well-mannered little princeling, but I saw no play of
      Promethean fire about his head, and when he spoke it sounded as if any
      normally intelligent young man was speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you expected,&rdquo; Pontycroft with lofty sarcasm inquired, &ldquo;that, like
      the prince in <i>The Rose and Ring</i>, he would speak in verse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But next morning, in the most unexpected manner, she totally changed her
      note. Pontycroft found her seated in the sun on the lawn. It was a cool
      morning, and the sun's warmth was pleasant. Here and there a dewdrop still
      glistened, clinging to a spear of grass; and the air was still sweet with
      the early breath of the earth. In her lap lay side by side an open letter
      and an oleander-blossom. Her eyes, Pontycroft perceived, were fixed upon
      the horizon, as those of one deep in a brown study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't mind my interrupting,&rdquo; he said, as he came up. &ldquo;It's really
      in your own interest. It's bad for your little brain to let it think so
      hard, and it will do you good to tell me what it was thinking so hard
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, calmly, Ruth raised her eyes to his. &ldquo;My little brain was thinking
      about Prince Charming,&rdquo; she apprised him, in a voice that sounded grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft's wrinkled brow contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Charming&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young Astyanax, the hope of&mdash;Altronde,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Your
      friend, Bertrando Bertrandoni. I was meditating his manifold
      perfections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft shook his head. &ldquo;I miss the point of your irony,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irony?&rdquo; protested she, with spirit. &ldquo;When was I ever ironical? He's
      perfectly delightful&mdash;so unassuming and unspoiled; and so romantic,
      like a king in exile. And with such a nice thin figure, and such large
      sagacious eyes. And he speaks such chaste and classic English, and is so
      quick to take a joke. If I weren't restrained by a sense of what's
      becoming to me as a single woman, I should make desperate love to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft shook his head again. &ldquo;I still miss the point,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I express myself blunderingly, I know,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;You see, it's
      somewhat embarrassing for a girl to have to avow such sentiments. But
      really and truly and honestly, and all jesting apart, I think he's an
      extremely nice young man, quite the nicest that I've met for a long, long
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sang a different song yesterday,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, bewilderment and
      suspicion mingled in his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>La nuit porte conseil</i>,&rdquo; Ruth reminded him. &ldquo;I've had leisure in
      which to revise my impressions. He's a fellow who can talk, a fellow who's
      curious about things. I hope we shall see a great deal of him.&rdquo; She lifted
      up her oleander, pressed it to her face, and took a deep inhalation.
      &ldquo;Bless its red fragrant heart,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never can tell when you are sincere,&rdquo; Ponty hopelessly complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm always sincere&mdash;but seldom serious,&rdquo; Ruth replied. &ldquo;What's the
      good of being serious? Isn't levity the soul of wit? Come, come! Life's
      grim enough, in all conscience, without making it worse by being serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you up,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;You're in one of your mystifying moods, and
      your long-suffering friends must wait until it passes.&rdquo; Then nodding
      towards the open letter in her lap, &ldquo;Whom's your letter from?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Ruth, smiling with what seemed to him artificial
      brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know? Haven't you read it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I've read it. But I don't know whom it's from, because it isn't
      signed. It's what they call anonymous,&rdquo; Ruth suavely answered. &ldquo;Now isn't
      <i>that</i> exciting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anonymous?&rdquo; cried Ponty, bristling up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who on earth can be writing anonymous letters to a child like you? What's
      it about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the oddest of coincidences,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;it's about <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About <i>me?</i>&rdquo; Ponty faltered, a hundred new wrinkles adding
      themselves to his astonished brow: &ldquo;An anonymous letter&mdash;to <i>you</i>&mdash;about
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ruth pleasantly. &ldquo;Would you care to read it?&rdquo; She held it up
      to him. He took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in a weak and sprawling hand, clearly feminine, on common white
      paper, it ran, transliterated into the conventional spelling of our day,
      as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Ruth Adgate, Madam.&mdash;I thought you might like to know that your
      friend, H. Pontycroft, Esq. who passes himself off for a bachelor is a
      married man, eighteen years ago being married privately to a lady whose
      father kept a public in Brighton of the name of Ethel Driver. The lady
      lives at 18 Spring Villas Beckenham Road Highgate off a mean pittance from
      her husband who is ashamed of her and long ago cast off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, a sincere well-wisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft's wrinkles, as he read, concentrated themselves into one frown
      of anger, and the brown-red of his face darkened to something like purple.
      At last he tore the letter lengthwise and crosswise into tiny fragments,
      and thrust them into the side pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the envelope,&rdquo; he said, reaching out his hand. But there was
      nothing to be got from the envelope. It was postmarked Chelsea, and had
      been addressed to Ruth's house in town, and thence forwarded by her
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could have written it? And why? Why?&rdquo; he puzzled aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The writer thought I 'might like to know,'&rdquo; said Ruth, quoting the text
      from memory. &ldquo;But, of course, it's none of my business&mdash;so I don't
      ask whether it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's none of your business,&rdquo; Ponty agreed, smiling upon her gravely,
      his anger no longer uppermost. &ldquo;But I hope you won't quite believe the
      part about the 'pittance.' My solicitors pay all her legitimate expenses,
      and if I don't allow her any great amount of actual money, that's because
      she has certain unfortunate habits which it's better for her own sake that
      she shouldn't indulge too freely. Well, well, you see how the sins of our
      youth pursue us. And now&mdash;shall we speak of something else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Harry,&rdquo; said Ruth, looking at him with eyes of tender pity. &ldquo;Speak
      of something else? Oh yes, by all means,&rdquo; she assented briskly. &ldquo;Let's
      return to Astyanax. When do you think he will pay his visit of digestion?&rdquo;

      of digestion as soon as, with any sort of countenance, he could&mdash;he
      paid it the next afternoon; and when he had gone, Pontycroft accused Ruth
      of having &ldquo;flirted outrageously&rdquo; with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth, her head high, repudiated the charge with a great show of
      resentment. &ldquo;Flirted? I was civil to him because he is a friend of yours.
      If you call that flirting, I shall know how to treat him the next time we
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; applauded Ponty, gently clapping his hands. Then he knotted their
      bony fingers round his knees, leaned back lazily, and surveyed her with
      laughing eyes. &ldquo;Beauty angered, Innocence righteously indignant! You draw
      yourself up to the full height of your commanding figure in quite the
      classic style; your glances flash like fierce Belinda's, when she flew
      upon the Baron; and I never saw anything so haughty as the elevated perk

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      let us not come to blows about a word. I don't know what recondite
      meanings you may attach to 'flirting'; but when a young woman hangs upon a
      man's accents, as if his lips were bright Apollo's lute strung with his
      hair, and responds with her own most animated conversation, and makes her
      very handsomest eyes at him, and falls one by one into all her most
      becoming poses, and appears rapt into oblivion of the presence of other
      people&mdash;flirting is what ordinary dictionary-fed English folk call
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he gave his head a jerk of satisfaction, as one whose theorem was
      driven home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth tittered&mdash;a titter that was an admission of the impeachment.
      &ldquo;Well? What would you have?&rdquo; she asked, with a play of the eyebrows. &ldquo;I
      take it for granted that you haven't produced this young man without a
      purpose, and I have never known you to produce any young man for any
      purpose except one. So the more briskly I lead him on, the sooner will he
      come to&mdash;to what, if I am not mistaken&rdquo;&mdash;she tilted her chin at
      an angle of inquiry&mdash;&ldquo;dictionary-fed English folk call the scratch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft gave his head a shake of disapproval. &ldquo;No, no; Bertram is too
      good a chap to be trifled with,&rdquo; he seriously protested. &ldquo;You shouldn't
      lead him on at all, if you mean in the end, according to what seems your
      incorrigible habit, to put him off.&rdquo; Ruth's eyebrows arched themselves in
      an expression of simplicity surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you suppose that I mean anything of the sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft studied her with a frown. &ldquo;You unconscionable little pickle! Do
      you mean that you would accept him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she answered slowly, reflecting. &ldquo;He's a very personable
      person. And he's a prince&mdash;which, of course, rather dazzles my
      democratic fancy. And I suppose he's well enough off not to be after a
      poor girl merely for her money. And&mdash;well&mdash;on the whole&mdash;don't
      you see?&mdash;well&mdash;perhaps a poor girl might go further and fare
      worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed her stammering conclusion by a drop of the eyelids and a tiny
      wriggle of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, when you said you would die a bachelor, you never thought you
      would live to be married,&rdquo; Pontycroft commented, making a face, slightly
      wry, the intention of which wasn't clear. He felt about his pockets for
      his cigarette case, lighted a cigarette, and smoked half an inch of it in
      silence. &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;here's news for your friends. And
      what&mdash;by the by&mdash;what about deathless Aphrodite? 'The only man
      you ever really cared for'&mdash;what becomes of that poor devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light kindled in Ruth's eyes; not an entirely friendly light; a light
      that seemed to threaten. But all she said was, &ldquo;How do you know that that
      poor devil isn't Bertram Bertrandoni himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gesture with which Pontycroft flicked the ash from his cigarette
      proclaimed him a bird not to be caught with chaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gammon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You'd never seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never seen him?&rdquo; retorted Ruth, her face astonished and reproachful. &ldquo;You
      are forgetting Venice. Why shouldn't I have lost my young affections to
      him that night at Venice? You haven't a notion how romantic it all was,
      with the moonlight and everything, and Lucilla quoting Byron, and then
      Astyanax, in a panama hat, dashing to our assistance like a knight out of
      a legend. Isn't it almost a matter of obligation for distressed females to
      fall in love with the knights who dash to their assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hruff,&rdquo; growled Pontycroft, smoking, &ldquo;why do you waste these pearls of
      sophistry on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she unblushingly owned up. &ldquo;The only man I've ever seriously
      cared for isn't Bertrando Bertrandoni. But what then? Let us look at it as
      men of the world. What has that poor devil got to do with the question of
      my marriage? You yourself told me that he was the last man alive I should
      think of leading to the altar. You said the persons we care for in our
      calf-period are always the wrong persons. And what some people say carries
      double weight, because&rdquo;&mdash;that not entirely friendly light flickered
      again in her eyes for a second&mdash;&ldquo;because they teach by example as
      well as precept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And of course the words weren't out of her mouth before she regretted
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft said nothing, made no sign. It may be that his sun-burned skin
      flushed a little, that the lines of his forehead wavered. He sat with his
      homely face turned towards Florence, and appeared to be considering the
      effect of his cigarette-smoke on the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth waited, and the interval seemed long. She looked guilty, she looked
      frightened, her eyes downcast, her lips parted, a conscious culprit,
      bowing her head to receive the blow she had provoked. But no blow fell.
      She waited as long as flesh and blood could stand the suspense. At last
      she sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried wildly, &ldquo;why don't you crush me? Why don't you tell me I'm
      a beast? Why don't you tell me you despise me&mdash;loathe me&mdash;for
      being&mdash;for being such a cad? Oh, Harry, I am so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him with tight-clasped hands, her whole form rigid in an
      anguish of contrition. To have taunted him with a thing for which she
      should have greatly pitied him, a secret she had no right even to know, a
      grief, a shame, to which in decency she should never remotely have alluded&mdash;oh,
      it was worse than brutal, it was cattish, treacherous, it was base.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he smiled up at her from calm eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the row?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What are you sorry about? You very neatly
      scored a point, that's all. Besides, on the subject in question, a fellow
      in the course of years will have said so many stinging things to himself
      as to have rendered him reasonably tough. And now then&rdquo;&mdash;he gaily
      shifted his key&mdash;&ldquo;since Bertram isn't the favoured swain, let us hope
      he soon will be. It's every bit as easy to fall in love with one man as
      with another, and often a good deal easier. Come&mdash;sit down&mdash;concentrate
      your mind upon Bertram's advantages&mdash;and remember that words break no
      bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's attitude had relaxed, her face had changed, contrition fading into
      what looked like disappointment, disillusion, and then like a kind of
      passive bitterness. Pontycroft waved his hand towards her chair.
      Automatically, absently, she obeyed him, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must beg pardon,&rdquo; she said, with rather a bitter little smile, &ldquo;for my
      exhibition of emotion. I had forgotten how Englishmen hate such
      exhibitions. It is vulgar enough to <i>feel</i> strong emotions&mdash;a
      sort of thing that should be left to foreigners and the lower classes; but
      to <i>show</i> them is to take an out-and-out liberty with the person we
      show them to, the worst possible bad form. Well, well! Words breaks no
      bones; 'hearts, though, sometimes,' the poet added: but there again, poets
      are vulgar-minded, human creatures, born as a general rule at Camberwell,
      and what can they know of the serene invulnerability of heart that is the
      test of real good-breeding? Anyhow&rdquo;&mdash;her face changed again, lighting
      up&mdash;&ldquo;what you say about its being often a good deal easier to fall in
      love with one man than with another is lamentably true&mdash;that's why we
      don't invariably love with reason. Your thought has elsewhere found
      expression in song&mdash;how does it go?&rdquo; Her eyes by this time were
      shining with quite their wonted mirthful fires, yet deep down in them I
      think one might still have discerned a shadow of despite, as she sang:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rien n'y fait, menace ou prière;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      L'un parle bien, l'autre se tait;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Et c'est l'autre que je préfère,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Il n'a rien dit, mais il me plaît.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank goodness,&rdquo; cried the cheerful voice of Lucilla. &ldquo;Thank goodness for
      a snatch of song.&rdquo; Plump and soft, her brown hair slightly loosened, her
      fair skin flushed a little by the warmth of the afternoon, she came, with
      that &ldquo;languid grace&rdquo; which has been noted, up the terrace steps, her arms
      full of fresh-cut roses, so that she moved in the centre of a nebula of
      perfume. &ldquo;Only I wish now it had been a blackbird or a thrush. I've spent
      half an hour wandering in the garden, and not a bird sang once. The
      silence was quite dispiriting. A garden without birds is a more ridiculous
      failure than a garden without flowers. I think I shall give this villa
      up.&rdquo; She shed her roses into a chair, and let herself, languidly,
      gracefully, sink into another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birds never do sing in the autumn&mdash;do they?&rdquo; questioned Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no excuse,&rdquo; complained Lucilla. &ldquo;Why don't they? Isn't it what
      they're made for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robins do,&rdquo; said Ponty, &ldquo;they're singing their blessed little hearts out
      at this very moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Lucilla eagerly, starting up. &ldquo;I'll go and hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England,&rdquo; answered her brother; &ldquo;from every bush and hedgerow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-r-r-r-h!&rdquo; Lucilla ejaculated, deep in her throat, turning upon him a
      face that was meant to convey at once a sense of outrage and a thirst for
      vengeance, and showing her pretty teeth. &ldquo;Humbug is such a cheap
      substitute for wit. Why don't other birds sing? Why don't blackbirds,
      thrushes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Pontycroft obligingly explained, &ldquo;birds are chock-full of
      feminine human nature. They're the artists of the air, and&mdash;you know
      the proverb&mdash;every artist is at heart a woman. June when they woo,
      December when they wed, they sing&mdash;just as women undulate their hair&mdash;to
      beguile the fancy of the male upon whom they have designs. But once he's
      safely married and made sure of, the feminine spirit of economy asserts
      itself, and they sing no longer. <i>A quoi bon?</i> They save their breath
      to cool their pottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What perfect nonsense,&rdquo; said Lucilla, curling a scornful lip. &ldquo;It's a
      well-known fact that only the male birds sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of male and female,&rdquo; Ponty asked, &ldquo;has it never occurred to you
      that some one ought to invent a third sex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A third?&rdquo; expostulated Ruth, wide-eyed. &ldquo;Good heavens! Aren't there
      already two too many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is too many, if you like,&rdquo; Ponty distinguished, uncoiling his legs
      and getting upon his feet, &ldquo;but two are not enough. There should be a
      third, for men to choose their sisters from. You women have always been
      too good for us, and nowadays, with your higher education, you're becoming
      far too clever. See how Lucilla caught me out on a point in natural
      history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which he retreated into the house.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      But a week or so later, Bertram having found an almost daily occasion for
      coming to Villa Santa Cecilia, &ldquo;It really does begin to look,&rdquo; Ponty said,
      in a tone that sounded tentatively exultant, &ldquo;as if at last we were more
      or less by way of getting her off our hands. <i>Unberufen</i>,&rdquo; he made
      haste to add, zealously tapping the arm of his wicker chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Lucilla doubted, her eyebrows going up. Then, on
      reflection, &ldquo;It certainly looks,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;as if Prince Bertrandoni
      were very much taken with her. But so many men have been that, poor
      dears,&rdquo; she remembered, sighing, &ldquo;and you know with what fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but in this case I'm thinking of <i>her</i>,&rdquo; Ponty eagerly
      discriminated. &ldquo;It's she who seems taken with Prince Bertrandoni. I half
      believe she's actually in love with him&mdash;and, anyhow, I wouldn't mind
      betting she'd accept him. <i>Unberufen</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla's soft face wondered. &ldquo;In love with him?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why
      should you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, reasons as plentiful as blackberries,&rdquo; Ponty answered. &ldquo;The way in
      which she brightens up at his arrival, absorbs herself in him while he's
      here, wilts at his departure, and then, during his absence, mopes, pines,
      muses, falls pensive at all sorts of inappropriate moments, as one whose
      heart is hugging something secret and bitter-sweet. Of course, I'm only a
      man, and inexperienced, but I should call these the symptoms of a maid in
      love&mdash;and evidences that she loves her love with a B. However, in
      love or not, it's plain she likes him immensely, and I'll bet a sovereign
      she's made up her mind to marry him if he asks her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he'll ask her fast enough,&rdquo; Lucilla with confidence predicted. &ldquo;It's
      only a question of her giving him a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ponty shook his wrinkled brow. &ldquo;I wish I were cocksure of that,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;You see, after all, he's not as other men. On one side he's a
      semi-royalty, and there are dynastic considerations; on t'other side he's
      a Wohenhoffen, and, with every respect for the house of Adgate, I'm
      doubting whether the Wohenhoffens would quite regard them as even
      birthish. Of course, she has money, and money might go a long way towards
      rose-colouring their visions. Still, their vision is a thing he'd have to
      reckon with. No&mdash;I'm afraid he may continue to philander, and let 'I
      dare not' wait upon 'I would,' unless she gives him a good deal more than
      a mere chance&mdash;unless she gives him positive encouragement&mdash;unless,
      in fine, by showing the condition of her own heart she sweeps the poor
      fellow off his feet. You question whether she's in love with him. Dear
      child, why shouldn't she be? 'Tis Italy, 'tis springtime, and whither
      should a young girl's fancy turn? Besides, she has red hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Springtime?&rdquo; protested Lucilla. &ldquo;I thought it was September.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; agreed her brother, flourishing his cigarette. &ldquo;But September
      in Italy is proud-pied April under a pseudonym. The April winds are
      passional for bachelors and dames. Besides, she has red hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red hair?&rdquo; protested Lucilla. &ldquo;Her hair is brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; agreed her brother, with a second flourish. &ldquo;But the larger
      includes the less. I did not say she was a red-haired woman. A red-haired
      woman is red, a black-haired woman is black, and there's an end on't;
      expect no mystery, no semi-tones, no ambiguities. I said she had red hair,
      and so she has, since her hair is brown. A brown-haired woman is
      everything, is infinite variety, is as elusively multi-coloured as a dying
      dolphin. A brown-haired woman's hair is red, black, blue, green, purple,
      amber, with their thousand intermediates, according to mood and tense. Oh,
      give me a brown-haired woman, and surprises, improbabilities,
      perplexities, will never be to seek. A brown-haired woman has red hair,
      and red hair means a temperament and a temper. No, I honestly think our
      little brown-haired friend, in just so far as her hair is red, is feeling
      foolish about Bertram, and I look hopefully forward (<i>unberufen</i>) to
      the day when her temper or her temperament will get the better of her
      discretion, and let him see what's what. Then (<i>unberufen</i>) his
      native chivalry will compel him to offer her his hand. Thank goodness she
      has money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very handsome of you,&rdquo; said Ruth, for the first time coming into the
      conversation, though she had been present from its inception, &ldquo;it's very
      handsome indeed of you to take so much interest in my affairs&mdash;and to
      discuss them so frankly before my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> handsome of us,&rdquo; agreed Pontycroft, chucking his cigarette
      away, &ldquo;and I am glad you appreciate it. For we might be discussing the
      weather, a vastly more remunerative theme. Has it ever struck you how
      inept the duffers are who taboo the weather as a subject of conversation?
      There's nothing else in the physical universe so directly vital to man's
      welfare as the weather, nothing on which his comfort so immediately
      depends, and nothing (to take a higher ground) that speaks such an
      eloquent and varied language to his sense of beauty. The music of the
      wind, the colours of the sky, the palaces and pictures in the clouds! Yet
      duffers taboo it as a subject of conversation. The weather is the
      physiognomy of Heaven towards us, its smile or frown. What else should we
      discuss? Hello, here he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram came up the garden path and mounted the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;is arriving this evening from Vienna. I was
      wondering whether you would lunch with us to-morrow, to make her
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; whispered Ponty in Ruth's ear, &ldquo;this really does look like
      business. Madame Mère is coming to look you over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      I don't know how it is that certain people, without doing or saying
      anything that can be taken hold of, yet manage to convey to us a very
      definite and constant sense that they think themselves our betters. Oh, of
      course, there are people who ostentatiously carry their heads in the air,
      who openly swagger, patronise, condescend, but those are not the people I
      mean. I mean the people who are outwardly all pleasantness and respectful
      courtesy, and inwardly very likely all goodwill, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;we
      are somehow never allowed for an instant to forget that never do they for
      an instant become unconscious of their divinely appointed superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La Duchesse d'Oltramare, née Comtesse de Wohenhoffen,&rdquo; to copy the legend
      from her visiting-card, was rather a fat, distinctly an amiable woman of
      fifty-something, very smartly turned out in the matter of costume by those
      who are surely the cleverest milliners and dressmakers in the world, the
      Viennese. She had a milk-white skin, with a little pink in the scarcely
      wrinkled cheeks, and plump, smooth, milk-white hands, with polished, rosy
      nails. For the rest, her smiling mouth, the gleam of her grey eyes, and
      something crisp in the quality of her voice, seemed to connote wit and a
      sense of humour. Her son had described her to himself as the best-natured
      and the most sociable being alive; certainly on the morrow, at luncheon,
      she was all pleasantness, all cordiality even, to her son's guests; yet
      never, for an instant, could one of them forget that she was perpetually
      conscious of herself as a great personage, and of them as relatively very
      small folk indeed. I wish I could tell, I wish I could understand, how the
      thing was done. Of patronage or condescension&mdash;of the sort, at any
      rate, that could be formulated and resented&mdash;there wasn't any trace
      either in her talk or in her manner; nor of stiffness, pomposity,
      selfimportance. All pleasantness, all cordiality, she seemed to take them
      at once into her friendship, almost into her affection&mdash;she seemed to
      conceive (as Bertram had promised himself she would) a particular liking
      for each of them. And her talk was easy, merry, vivacious, intimate. Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd give a thousand pounds,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, as they drove home, &ldquo;for
      that woman's secret. She knows how to appear the joiliest old soul unhung&mdash;and
      to make other people feel like her fiddlers three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's insufferable,&rdquo; said Lucilla irritably. &ldquo;I should think a Pontycroft
      and the wife of an English baronet is as good as six foreign duchesses. I
      should like to put her in her place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Pontycroft, as much as you will,&rdquo; concurred her brother suavely, &ldquo;but
      you're only the wife of an Irish baronet, dear girl. No, it's something
      subtle, unseizable. Every word, look, gesture, hailed you as her friend
      and equal, and all of them together delicately kept you reminded that she
      was deigning hugely to honour a nobody. It's sheer odylic force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ate like five,&rdquo; Lucilla went spitefully on. &ldquo;She was helped twice to
      everything. And she emptied at least a whole bottle of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, as for that,&rdquo; Ponty said, &ldquo;a healthy appetite is a sign that
      its owner is human at the red-ripe of the heart. You didn't, by the by, do
      so badly yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she consumed her food with an <i>air</i>,&rdquo; Lucilla persisted, &ldquo;with a
      kind of devotional absorption, as if feeding herself was a religious
      sacrifice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you noticed also that she called Ruth 'my dear'?&rdquo; Ponty
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as if she was a dairymaid,&rdquo; sniffed Lucilla. &ldquo;I wonder you didn't
      turn and rend her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I liked her,&rdquo; Ruth replied. &ldquo;You see, we mere Americans are so inured
      to being treated with affability and put at our ease by our English
      cousins that we scarcely notice such things in foreigners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's lucky you like her,&rdquo; said Ponty, wagging his head, &ldquo;for you're
      in a fair way to see a good bit of her, if events move as they're moving.
      The crucial question, of course, is whether <i>she</i> liked <i>you</i>.
      If she did, I should call the deal as good as done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;deal&rdquo; seemed, at any rate, to advance a measurable step when, on the
      following afternoon, the Duchess called at the villa, for the purpose, as
      Pontycroft afterwards put it to Ruth, of &ldquo;taking up your character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Lady Dor,&rdquo; she said, beaming upon every one, and I wish I could
      render the almost cooing loving-kindness of her intonation, &ldquo;you will
      forgive me if I come like this <i>à l'improviste?</i> Yes? I was so
      anxious to see you again, and when people are mutually sympathetic, it is
      a pity to let time or etiquette delay the progress of their friendship,
      don't you think? Oh, kind Mr. Pontycroft,&rdquo; she purred, as Ponty handed her
      a cup of tea. &ldquo;Dear little Miss Adgate,&rdquo; as Ruth passed the bread and
      butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drank their tea in the great hall, and afterwards, linking her arm
      familiarly in Lucilla's, &ldquo;Dearest Lady Dor,&rdquo; she pronounced, in the
      accents of one pleading for a grace, &ldquo;I am so anxious to see your
      beautiful garden! You will show it to me? Yes? My son has told me so much
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when she and Lucilla, under their sunshades, were alone in the
      garden-paths, &ldquo;The outlook is magnificent,&rdquo; she vowed, with enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;You have Florence at your feet. Superb. Oh, the lovely roses! I might
      pick one&mdash;a little one? Yes? Ah, so kind. I wanted to ask about your
      charming little friend, that nice Miss Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Lucilla, in a tone of some remoteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duchess did not appear to notice it. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she blithely pursued.
      &ldquo;You don't mind? My son has told me so much about her. She is an American,
      I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess's eyes glowed with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ilex trees are wonderful&mdash;I have never seen grander ones. I am
      really envious. She has nice manners, and is distinguished-looking as well
      as pretty. I believe she is also&mdash;how do you say in English&mdash;<i>très
      bien dotée?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has about thirty thousand a year, I believe,&rdquo; said Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess stood still and all but gasped. &ldquo;Thirty thousand pounds?
      Pounds sterling?&rdquo; Then she resumed her walk. &ldquo;But that is princely. That
      is nearly a million francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a decent income,&rdquo; Lucilla admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is also, of course, what you call&mdash;well born?&rdquo; the Duchess
      threw out, as if the question were superfluous and its answer foregone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is what we call a gentlewoman,&rdquo; answered Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;of course,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;but&mdash;but without a
      title?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England titles are not necessary to gentility&mdash;as I believe they
      are in Austria,&rdquo; Lucilla mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;of course,&rdquo; said the Duchess. &ldquo;Her parents, I think, are
      not living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;they are dead,&rdquo; Lucilla redundantly responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so sad,&rdquo; murmured the Duchess, with a sympathetic movement of her
      bonnet. &ldquo;But then she is quite absolute mistress of her fortune? What a
      responsibility for one so young. And to crown all, she is a good pious
      Catholic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a Catholic,&rdquo; said Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house, from here, is really imposing&mdash;really <i>signorile</i>,&rdquo;
       the Duchess declared, considering it through her silver-framed double
      eyeglass. &ldquo;There are no houses like these old Florentine villas. Ah, they
      were a lovely race. You see, my son is very much interested in her. I have
      never known him to show so much interest in a girl before. It is natural I
      should wish to inform myself, is it not? If you will allow me, dear Lady
      Dor, to make you a confidence, I should be so glad to see him married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I suppose it is quite
      possible for him, in spite of his belonging to a reigning house, to marry
      a commoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess looked vague. &ldquo;A reigning house?&rdquo; she repeated, politely
      uncomprehending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bertrandoni-Altronde,&rdquo; Lucilla disjointedly explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Duchess, with a little toss of the head. &ldquo;The Bertrandoni
      do not count. They have not reigned for three generations, and they will
      never reign again. They have no more chance of reigning than they have of
      growing wings. The Altrondesi would not have them if they came bringing
      paradise in their hands. My husband's pretensions are absurd, puerile. He
      keeps them up merely that he may a little flatter himself that he is not
      too flagrantly the inferior of his wife. No, the Bertrandoni do not count.
      It is the Wohenhoffens who count. The Wohenhoffens were great lords and
      feudal chiefs in Styria centuries before the first Bertrandoni won his
      coat of arms. It was already a vast waiving of rank, it was just not a
      mésalliance, when a Wohenhoffen gave his daughter to a Bertrandoni in
      marriage. If my son were a Wohenhoffen in the male line, then indeed he
      could not possibly marry a commoner. But he is, after all, only a
      Bertrandoni. Even so, he could not marry a commoner of any of the
      Continental states&mdash;he could not marry outside the Almanach de Gotha.
      But in England, as you say, it is different. There all are commoners
      except the House of Peers, and a title is not necessary to good <i>noblesse</i>.
      In any case, it would be for the Wohenhoffens, not for the Bertrandoni, to
      raise objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess, by a gesture, proposed a return to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for receiving me so kindly, and for
      answering all my tiresome questions. You have set my mind quite at ease.
      Your garden is perfect&mdash;even more beautiful than my son had led me to
      expect. And the view of Florence! You have children of your own? Ah,
      daughters. No, boys? Ah, but you are young. The proper thing for him to
      do, of course, as she is without parents, would be to address himself to
      your good brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it is not my brother whom he wishes to marry,&rdquo; said Lucilla, &ldquo;I should
      think the proper thing might be for him to address the young lady
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess laughed. &ldquo;Ah, you English are so unconventional,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the Duchess had left them, and Lucilla had reported her
      cross-examination, &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Ponty, with an odd effect of discontent
      in the circumstance, &ldquo;it is as I told you&mdash;the deal is practically
      done. Now that mamma has taken up your character, and found it
      satisfactory, it only remains for&mdash;for Mr. Speaker to put the
      question. Well,&rdquo; his voice sounded curiously joyless, &ldquo;I wish you joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Ruth, who did not look especially joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence for a few minutes; then Ponty got up and strolled off
      into the garden; whither, in a few minutes more, Lucilla followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Harry?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You seem a bit hipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a rather forced smile. &ldquo;I feel silly and grown old,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Suppose it's all a ghastly mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mistake&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Lucilla faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he broke out, with a kind of gloomy petulance, &ldquo;it was all very well
      so long as it hung fire. One joked about it, chaffed her about it. Deep
      down in one's inside one didn't believe it would ever really come to
      anything. But now? Marriage, you see, when you examine the bare bones of
      it, is a damnably serious business. After all, it involves sanctities.
      Suppose she doesn't care for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla looked bewildered. &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The other day you assured
      me that she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she does&mdash;but suppose she doesn't? I was talking in the air.
      Down deep one didn't believe. But this official visit from Mamma! We're
      suddenly at grip with an actuality. If she doesn't care for him&mdash;by
      Jove,&rdquo; he nodded portentously, &ldquo;you and I will have something to answer
      for. It's a threadbare observation, but all at once it glitters with
      pristine truth, that a woman who marries a man without loving him sells
      her soul to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she doesn't love him, she won't accept him. Why should she?&rdquo; said
      Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the worst of selling your soul to the devil,&rdquo; Pontycroft went
      morosely on, &ldquo;is that the sly old beggar gives you nothing for it. Legends
      like Faust, where he gives beauty, youth, wealth, unlimited command of the
      pleasures of the world and the flesh, are based upon entire misinformation
      as to his real way of doing business. Look here; the devil has been
      acquiring souls continuously for the past five thousand years. Practice
      has made him a perfect dab at the process&mdash;and he was born a perfect
      Jew. You may be sure he doesn't go about paying the first price asked&mdash;not
      he. He bides his time. He waits till he catches you in a scrape, or
      desperately hard up, or drunk, or out of your proper cool wits with anger,
      pride, lust, whichever of the seven deadly impulses you will, and then he
      grinds you like a money-lender, or chouses you like a sharper at a fair.
      Silver or gold gives he none, at most a handful of gilded farthings. And I
      know one man to whom he gave&mdash;well, guess. Nothing better than a
      headache the next morning. Oh, trust the devil. He knows his trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; said Lucilla, and eyed her brother with perplexity.
      The wrinkles of his brow were black and deep. &ldquo;You are in a state of mind.
      What has happened to you? Don't be a bird of evil omen. There's no
      question here of souls or devils&mdash;it's just a question of a very
      suitable match between young people who are fond of each other. Come!
      Don't be a croaker. I never knew you to croak like this before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it all,&rdquo; answered Ponty, &ldquo;I never had occasion. She's refused every
      one. Why does she suddenly make up her mind to accept this one? Well, I
      only hope it isn't because she thinks at last she has got her money's
      worth of titular dignity. Her Serene Highness the Princess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious!&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;I don't understand you. Would you wish
      her to go on refusing people until she died an old maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you one thing, anyhow&mdash;but under the rose,&rdquo; said Ponty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Lucilla, with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet you nine and elevenpence three-farthings that I can beat you at
      a game of tennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Lucilla, dashed. But after a moment, cheerfully, &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; she
      assented. &ldquo;I don't want to win your money&mdash;but anything to restore
      you to your normal self.&rdquo; They set off for the tennis court.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      And then, all at once, out of the blue came that revolution which, for
      nine days more or less, made obscure little Altronde the centre of the
      world's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, as will be remembered, when the Grand Duke was at luncheon,
      entertaining the officers of his guard; and it must have been a highly
      amusing scene. Towards the end of the refection, Colonel Benedetti,
      contrary to all usage and etiquette, rose and said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, I give you
      the Grand Duke.&rdquo; Whereupon twenty gallant uniforms sprang to their feet
      crying, &ldquo;The Grand Duke! the Grand Duke!&rdquo; with hands extended towards that
      monarch. Only each hand held, instead of a charged bumper of champagne, a
      charged revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massimiliano, according to his genial daily custom, was already
      comfortably intoxicated, but at this he fell abruptly sober. White, with
      chattering teeth, &ldquo;What do you mean? What do you want?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Benedetti succinctly explained, while the twenty revolvers
      continued to cover his listener. &ldquo;Speaking for the army and people of
      Altronde, I beg to inform Your Highness that we are tired of you&mdash;tired
      of your rule and tired of your extravagant and disgusting habits. I hold
      in my hand an Act of Abdication, which Your Highness will be good enough
      to sign.&rdquo; He thrust an elaborately engrossed parchment under the Duke's
      nose, and offered him a fountain pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is treason,&rdquo; said Massimiliano. &ldquo;It is also,&rdquo; was his happy
      anti-climax, &ldquo;a gross abuse of hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign&mdash;sign!&rdquo; sang one-and-twenty martial voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should read the document first. Do I abdicate in favour of my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Highness has no legitimate son,&rdquo; Benedetti politely reminded him,
      &ldquo;and Altronde has no throne for a bastard. You abdicate in favour of
      Civillo Bertrandoni, Duke of Oltramare, already our sovereign in the
      rightful line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Massimiliano plucked up a little spirit. &ldquo;Bertrandoni&mdash;the hereditary
      enemy of my house? That I will never do. You may shoot me if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so much a question of shooting,&rdquo; said the urbane Colonel. &ldquo;We
      cover Your Highness with our firearms merely to ensure his august
      attention. It is a question of perpetual imprisonment in a fortress&mdash;and
      deprivation of alcoholic stimulants.&rdquo; Massimiliano's jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas,&rdquo; the Colonel added, &ldquo;in the event of peaceful abdication, Your
      Highness receives a pension of one hundred thousand francs, and can reside
      anywhere he likes outside the Italian peninsula&mdash;in Paris, for
      example, where alcohol in many agreeable forms is plentiful and cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign&mdash;sign!&rdquo; sang twenty voices, with a lilt of gathering
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course poor Massimiliano signed, Civillo forthwith was proclaimed from
      the palace steps, and at five o'clock that afternoon, amid much popular
      rejoicing, he entered his capital. He had happened, providentially, to be
      sojourning incognito in the nearest frontier town.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      When next morning the news reached Villa Santa Cecilia, by the medium of a
      dispatch in the <i>Fieramosca</i>, we may believe it caused excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it can't be true,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;Only two days ago the Duchess
      assured me&mdash;in all good faith, I'm certain&mdash;that her husband had
      no more chance of regaining his throne than he had of growing wings, and
      Bertram himself has always scoffed at the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;But perhaps Bertram and his mother were not entirely
      in the Pretender's confidence. This story, for a fake, is surprisingly
      apropos of nothing, and surprisingly circumstantial. No, I'm afraid it's
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reread the dispatch, frowning, seeking discrepancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's manifestly true,&rdquo; was his conclusion. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to go
      down to the Lung 'Arno, and offer Bertram our congratulations. And as for
      you&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed to Ruth,&mdash;&ldquo;pray accept the expression of our
      respectful homage. Here, instead of an empty title, is the reversion of a
      real grand-ducal crown. And you a mere little American! What trifling
      results from mighty causes flow. A People rise in Revolution&mdash;that a
      mere little American girl may adorn her brown-red hair with a grand-ducal
      crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The People don't appear to have had any voice in the matter,&rdquo; said
      Lucilla, poring over the paper. &ldquo;It was just a handful of officers. It was
      what they call a Palace Revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was what the judicious call a Comic Opera Revolution,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;It
      was a Palace version of Box and Cox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went down to the Lung 'Arno, and found Bertram, pale, agitated, in the
      midst of packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't talk of congratulations,&rdquo; the troubled young
      man cried, walking up and down the floor, and all but wringing his hands,
      while his servant went methodically on folding trousers and waistcoats.
      &ldquo;This may be altogether the worst thing that could possibly have happened,
      so far as I'm concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you're packing,&rdquo; Pontycroft remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we've had a telegram from my father ordering us to join him at
      once. We leave at twelve o'clock by a special train. My dear chap, I'm
      sick. I'm in a cold perspiration. Feel my hands.&rdquo; His hands were indeed
      cold and wet. He pressed one of them to his side. &ldquo;And there's something
      here that weighs like a ton of ice. I can hardly breathe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The remedy indicated,&rdquo; said Ponty, &ldquo;is a brandy-and-soda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bertram's gesture pushed the remedy from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A single spoonful would make me drunk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm as nearly as
      possible off my head already. I feel as if I were going out to be hanged.
      If it weren't for my mother&mdash;some one's got to go with her&mdash;upon
      my word, I'd funk it, and take the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Allons donc</i>,&rdquo; Ponty remonstrated. &ldquo;A certain emotion is what you
      must expect&mdash;it's part of the game. But think of your luck. Think of
      your grandeurs. Think of the experience, the adventure, that's before you.
      To be a real, actual, practising Royalty, a Royal Heir Apparent. Think of
      the new angle of view from which you'll be able to look at life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luck? Don't speak of it,&rdquo; Bertram groaned. &ldquo;If I had known, if I had
      dreamed. But we were kept in the dark absolutely. Oh, it was outrageous of
      the old man. We had a right at least to be warned, hadn't we? Since it
      involves our entire destinies? Since every one of our hopes, plans,
      intentions, great or small, is affected by it? We had a right to be
      warned, if not to be consulted. But never a word&mdash;until this morning&mdash;first
      the newspaper&mdash;and then his wire. Think of my mother being left to
      learn the thing from a newspaper. And then his wire: 'Come at once to
      Altronde.' I feel like a conscript. I feel like a man suddenly summoned
      from freedom to slavery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find your chains bearable&mdash;you'll find them interesting,&rdquo;
       Ponty said. &ldquo;You leave at noon by a special train. Is there any way,
      meanwhile, in which I can be useful to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no&mdash;no. Unless you can devise some way to get me out of
      the mess. The special train is for my mother. In her own fashion she's as
      much upset as I am. She could not travel <i>coram publico</i>, poor lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. I hope you will make her my compliments,&rdquo; said Ponty,
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. And you will say good-bye to Lady Dor for us and&mdash;and to
      Miss Adgate,&rdquo; Bertram responded. But there was a catch in his voice, and
      he grew perceptibly paler. &ldquo;I&mdash;I,&rdquo; he stumbled, hesitated, &ldquo;I will
      write to you as soon as I know where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ponty went home thoughtful; thoughtful, but conscious of an elusive inward
      satisfaction. This rather puzzled him. &ldquo;It's the sort of thing one feels
      when one has succeeded in evading an unpleasant duty&mdash;a sentiment of
      snugness, safety, safety and relief. But what unpleasant duty have I
      succeeded in evading?&rdquo; he asked himself. Yet there it was&mdash;the
      comfortable sense of a duty shirked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in doubt whether to hail you as the Queen Elect of Yvetot, or to
      offer you my condolences upon the queering of your pitch,&rdquo; he said to
      Ruth. &ldquo;He loved and rode away. He certainly loved, and he's as certainly
      riding away&mdash;at twelve o'clock to-day, by a special train. I supposed
      he would charge me with a message for you&mdash;but no&mdash;none except a
      commonplace good-bye. No promise, nothing compromising, nothing that could
      be used as evidence against him. However, he said he'd write&mdash;as soon
      as he knew whether he was standing on his head or on his heels. One thing,
      though, you might do&mdash;there's still time. You might go to the railway
      station and cover his flight with mute reproaches. Perhaps the sight of
      your distraught young face would touch his conscience. You might get the
      necessary word from him before the train started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Harry,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;You shan't chaff her any longer. Prince
      Bertrandoni is a man of honour&mdash;and he's as good as pledged to her
      already. This is a merely momentary interruption. As soon as he's adjusted
      his affairs to the new conditions, he'll come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, we know these comings back,&rdquo; answered Ponty, ominously. &ldquo;But a wise
      fisherman lands his fish while it's on the hook, and doesn't give it a
      chance of swimming away and coming back. I see a pale face at the window,
      watching, waiting; and I hear a sad voice murmuring, 'He cometh not.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're intolerable,&rdquo; Lucilla cried out, with an impatient gesture. &ldquo;Ruth,
      don't pay him the least attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't mind me,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;I'm vastly amused. Faithful are the
      wounds of a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's just one element of hope,&rdquo; Ponty ended, &ldquo;and that is that even to
      demi-semi Royalty a matter of thirty thousand a year must be a
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A column from Altronde in the <i>Fieramosca</i> of the morrow gave a
      glowing description of Bertram's and his mother's arrival, which
      Pontycroft translated at the breakfast table: how the Grand Duke, in the
      uniform of a general, met and tenderly embraced them as they stepped from
      the train, and drove with them in a &ldquo;lando di gala&rdquo; through streets
      brilliant with flags and thronged by cheering subjects, to the Palace,
      escorted by the selfsame regiment of guards whose officers the other day
      had so summarily cooked the goose of Massimiliano. &ldquo;That is pretty and
      touching,&rdquo; was Ponty's comment, &ldquo;but listen to this&mdash;this is rich.
      The Grand Duke introduced them to his people, in a proclamation, as 'my
      most dear and ever dutiful son, and my beloved consort, the companion and
      consoler of my long exile!' What so false as truth is? Well, there's
      nothing either true or false but thinking makes it so. And the mayor and
      corporation, in a loyal address, welcomed Bertram as the 'heir to the
      virtues as well as to the throne of his august progenitor.' His august
      progenitor's virtues were jewels which, during his career in Paris, at any
      rate, he modestly concealed. However! Oh, but here&mdash;here's something
      that really <i>is</i> interesting. 'The festivities of the evening were
      terminated by a banquet, at which the Grand Duke graciously made a
      speech.' Listen to one of the things he said: 'It has been represented to
      me as the earnest aspiration of my people that my solemn coronation should
      be celebrated at the earliest possible date. But unhappily, the crown of
      my fathers has been sullied by contact with the brows of a usurping
      dynasty. That crown I will never wear. A new, a virgin crown must be
      placed upon the head of your restored legitimate sovereign. And I herewith
      commission my dear son, whom Heaven has endowed, among many noble gifts,
      with the eye and the hand of an artist, to design a crown which shall be
      worthy of his sire, himself, and his posterity.' Well, that will keep
      Bertram out of mischief. I see him from here&mdash;see and hear him&mdash;bending
      over his drawing-board, with busy pencil, and whistling 'The girl I left
      behind me.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then a servant entered bearing a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me,&rdquo; Ponty asked, when he had opened and glanced at
      it, &ldquo;if I'll read this out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom's it from?&rdquo; asked Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last person on earth that you'd expect,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Come, what
      will you give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it's from Prince Bertrandoni himself,&rdquo; cried Lucilla, agog. &ldquo;If
      it is, we'll give you fits if you <i>don't</i> read it out&mdash;and at
      once.&rdquo; She showed him her clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Under that threat, I'll read it,&rdquo; remarked Ponty, and he read:
      &ldquo;Arrived safely, but homesick for dear Villa Santa Cecilia. My mother
      joins her thanks to mine for your constant kindness. Will write as soon as
      an hour of tranquillity permits. Please give my affectionate greetings to
      Lady Dor and Miss Adgate, and beg them not to forget their and your
      devoted Bertram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; crowed Lucilla. &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ponty looked up blankly. &ldquo;What did you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he would come back&mdash;that this was only a momentary
      interruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he say anything about coming back?&rdquo; Ponty asked, scrutinizing the
      straw-coloured paper. &ldquo;That must have missed my eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;What does he mean by the hope of an early reunion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A slip of the pen for blessed resurrection, I expect,&rdquo; said Ponty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boo,&rdquo; said Lucilla. &ldquo;It's the message of a man obviously, desperately, in
      love&mdash;yearning to communicate with his loved one&mdash;but to save
      appearances, or from lover-like timidity perhaps, addressing his
      communication to a third person. That telegram is meant exclusively for
      Ruth, and <i>you're</i> merely used as a gooseberry. Oh, Ruth, I <i>do</i>
      congratulate you.&rdquo; Ruth vaguely laughed.

      PART FOURTH
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR quite a week&mdash;wasn't
      it?&mdash;obscure little Altronde held the centre of the stage. The
      newspapers of France and England, as well as those of Italy, had daily
      paragraphs. Belated details, coming in like stragglers after a battle,
      gave vividness to the story. Massimiliano, at Paris, plaintively
      indignant, overflowed in interviews. In interviews also, in speeches, in
      proclamations, Civillo adumbrated, magniloquently, vaguely, his future
      policy. There were &ldquo;Character Sketches,&rdquo; reminiscent, anecdotal, of
      Civillo, &ldquo;By a lifelong Friend,&rdquo; of Massimiliano, &ldquo;By a Former Member of
      his Household,&rdquo; etc. etc. There were even character sketches of poor
      Bertram, &ldquo;By an Old Harrovian,&rdquo; &ldquo;By One who knew him at Cambridge,&rdquo; which
      I hope he enjoyed reading. In the illustrated papers, of course, there
      were portraits. And in some of the weightier periodicals the past history
      of Altronde was recalled, a bleak, monotonous history, little more than a
      catalogue of murders....
    </p>
    <p>
      With dagger thrusts and cups of poison, for something like three long sad
      hundred years, the rival houses of Bertrandoni and Ceresini had played the
      game of give and take. Finally, there were leading articles condemning the
      revolution as an act of brigandage, hailing it as a forward step towards
      liberty and light. And then, at the week's end, the theme was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may believe that the newspapers were read with interest at Villa Santa
      Cecilia, and that to the mistress of that household, on the subject of
      Altronde, they never seemed to contain enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's almost as if we'd had a hand in the affair,&rdquo; she reflected; &ldquo;but
      these scrappy newspaper accounts leave us with no more knowledge than as
      if we were complete outsiders. Why don't they give more particulars? Why
      aren't they more <i>intime?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what,&rdquo; said Ponty, &ldquo;let's go there. It's only half a day's
      journey. There we can study the question on the spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and look as if we were running after him. No, thank you,&rdquo; sniffed
      Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say we should look a little like accusing spirits, if he saw us,&rdquo;
       Ponty admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let's go in disguise. We can shave our heads, stain our skins, wear
      elastic-sided boots and pass ourselves off as an Albanian currant merchant
      and his family travelling to improve our minds in foreign politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see Ruth and myself,&rdquo; Lucilla yawned, &ldquo;swathed in embroideries and
      wearing elasticsided boots, and presently we should be arrested as spies,
      and when our innocent curiosity had been well aired by the press, we
      should look to Bertram Bertrandoni more like accusing spirits than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You women,&rdquo; growled Pontycroft, extracting a cigarette from his cigarette
      case, &ldquo;are so relentlessly cautious! You have no faith in the unexpected!
      That's why you'll never know the supreme content of throwing your bonnets
      over the mills, regardless of consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Consequences!&rdquo; Lucilla retorted, &ldquo;they're too obvious. We should be
      left bareheaded, <i>et voilà tout!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well&mdash;there you are,&rdquo; replied Ponty, and touched a match to his
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we may believe that the newspapers were read with interest at the
      Villa Santa Cecilia and that they gave the man there occasion for what his
      sister called &ldquo;a prodigious deal of jawing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my poor Ariadne,&rdquo; he commiserated, &ldquo;ginger is still hot in the
      mouth, and Naxos is still a comfortable place of sojourn. Our star has
      been snatched from us and borne aloft to its high orbit in the heavens; we
      from our lowly coigne of earth can watch and unselfishly rejoice at its
      high destiny. Of course, the one thing to regret is that you didn't nail
      him when you had him. Nail the wild star to its track in the half climbed
      Zodiac,&rdquo; he advised, sententious.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in spirit ripe for mischief, Ponty bethought him of a long-forgotten
      poem, and he went all the way down to Vieusseux to procure a volume of the
      works of Wordsworth. Henceforth, dreamily, from time to time, he would
      fall to repeating favourite lines. For nearly a day Ruth bore, with
      equanimity tempered by repartee, a volley of verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;He was a lovely youth, I guess&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      said Ponty,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The panther in the wilderness
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was not so fair as he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot dispute it. He was good-looking,&rdquo; Ruth suavely returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;this he let fall from the terrace an hour later, to Ruth
      engaged below in snipping dead leaves from Lucilla's clambering rose
      bushes,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;But, when his father called, the youth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Deserted his poor bride, and Ruth
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Could never find him more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fathers make, like mothers, I imagine, a poor substitute for brides,&rdquo;
       said Ruth. She glanced at him with amusement. &ldquo;Never, my nurse used to
      tell me, is a good while. Did that foolish youth find his bride?&rdquo; she
      added, absorbed apparently in her occupation, &ldquo;when he came back to claim
      her? As he did at last, you may rest assured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft made no reply to this question, but he placed his book on the
      table and prepared to descend the steps:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;God help thee, Ruth,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Such pains she had
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That she in half a year went mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure she would have gone mad in twenty-four hours if you had been by
      to persecute the poor thing,&rdquo; answered Ruth. She beat a hasty retreat
      towards the Pergola, whither, she knew, Ponty's laziness would check
      pursuit of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Ruth was left half desolate,&rdquo; Ponty, casually, after luncheon,
      observed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Her lover took another state.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And Ruth not thirty years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, it seems to me, was old enough to have known better,&rdquo; retorted his
      victim with asperity. &ldquo;You haven't scanned that last line properly either.
      'And Ruth not thirty years old' gives the correct lilt.&rdquo; Ruth sat down to
      write her letters. She turned her back with deliberation upon her
      tormentor, who answered: &ldquo;Oh, yes, thanks,&rdquo; and went off murmuring and
      tattooing on his fingers,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;And Ruth not thirty years old....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Towards five o'clock of that day, Lucilla and Ruth, spurred and booted&mdash;hatted
      and gloved from their afternoon's drive, appeared for tea upon the
      terrace. Ponty without loss of time opened fire:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;A slighted child, at her own will,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Went wandering over dale and hill
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In thoughtless freedom bold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I can't wander, in thoughtless freedom bold, over dale and hill
      in this fair false land of Italy,&rdquo; cried Ruth, exasperated, &ldquo;I should
      start at once for a fortnight's walking tour. I feel an excessive desire
      to remove myself from a deluge of poetic allusions which threatens to get
      on my nerves. Moreover,&rdquo; she added severely, &ldquo;I quite fail to see their
      application.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, drew her gloves off with a little militant air, and prepared
      to pour the tea which the servant had placed upon a table at her elbow. In
      the fine October weather the terrace, provided with abundance of tables,
      chairs and rugs, made, with its superb view over Florence, the pleasantest
      of <i>al fresco</i> extensions to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, there, Ruthie!&rdquo; soothed Pontycroft, &ldquo;don't resent a little
      natural avuncular chaff. <i>I must play the fool or play the devil</i>.
      You wouldn't wish to suppress my devouring curiosity, would you? Here's a
      situation brimful of captivating possibilities. You wouldn't have me sit
      in unremunerative silence, in sterile torpor before this case of a little
      American girl, who, on any day of the week, may be called to assume the
      exalted rôle of Crown Princess of Altronde?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; frowned Ruth, &ldquo;I should very much like to suppress your devouring
      curiosity; I should like extremely to reduce you to a state of
      unremunerative silence, torpor, on that verily sterile topic. And,
      moreover, so far as I can see, the Royal Incident may now be billeted
      closed, for weal or for woe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can never be quite sure about these Royal Incidents,&rdquo; her tormentor
      persisted, &ldquo;that's the lark about 'em&mdash;they're never closed. For
      sheer pig-headed obstinacy give me a Crown Prince. Our friend Bertram is
      capable of letting his Queen Mamma in for a deal of trouble in view of
      present circumstances, if she should, as she's likely to do&mdash;want now
      to marry him off to some Semi-Royalty or German Grand Duchess or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Si puo</i>,&rdquo; riposted Ruth with hauteur, &ldquo;I withdraw myself in advance
      from the competition. And I should like, please, to be spared any more
      allusions to the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here Lucilla, who had been sipping her tea and worshipping the view,
      interrupted them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do <i>please</i> cease from wrangling,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;Hold your breaths
      both of you&mdash;and behold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A haze all golden,&mdash;an impalpable dust of gold,&mdash;filled the
      entire watch-tower of the Heavens. Florence, twice glorified, lay bathed
      in yellow light that filtered benignantly upon roofs and gardens, played,
      glanced, upon Duomo, Campanile, and Baptistry. The Arno had become a way
      of gold. Webs of yellow gauze, spun across the streets and reflected by a
      thousand windows, made, among the many gardens, a burnished background for
      the twigs and branches of dark aspiring cypresses, glossy leaved ilexes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth and Pontycroft held their breaths, and, for a moment, there was a
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Lucilla said at length,&mdash;she gave a little soft sigh of
      satisfaction,&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder what Prince Bertrandoni has done with
      Balzatore.... Taken him, do you suppose, to reign over the dogs of
      Altronde? I miss that dog sadly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Balzatore?&mdash;Oh,&rdquo; said Ponty, &ldquo;Balzatore is throning it at the
      Palazzo Reale.... He has a special attendant who waits on him, sees to his
      bodily comforts; prepares his food, takes him for his walks,&mdash;for of
      course Bertram is far too involved in Court functions, too tied by
      etiquette and the fear of Anarchists to go for long solitary rambles; and
      Balzatore bullies the servants, one and all, you may be sure. Dogs, even
      the best of 'em, are shocking snobs. In a measure Balzatore is enjoying
      himself. It hardly requires a pen'orth of imagination to be positive of
      it. And,&rdquo; Pontycroft continued, &ldquo;I hear that the Palazzo Bertrandoni has
      been leased for a number of years to an American painter. By the way, it
      seems that Bertram's bookcases, which, saving your presences, I grieve to
      state, were filled with very light literature&mdash;the writings of
      decadent poets, people who begin with a cynicism&rdquo;&mdash;Pontycroft paused,
      hesitated for the just word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cynicism with which nobody ends!&rdquo; Ruth interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invaluable young thing! Thanks awfully. Who begin, as you say, with a
      cynicism with which nobody ends, as you quite aptly infer. Filled, too, I
      regret to state, with rare editions, a trifle, well&mdash;perhaps a bit
      eighteenth century&mdash;and with yellow paper-covered French novels.
      These bookcases are expiating a life of frivolity within the four walls of
      a Convent. They were offered by Bertram's mother to some Sisters of
      Charity whose temporal welfare she looks after. The good nuns were glad to
      have the shelves for their poor schools and have packed them with edifying
      books.... So it happens that to-day they ornament both sides of the
      Convent-Parloir, and thus it is that Bertram's bookshelves are atoning for
      the gay, wild, extravagant, old days within convent walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla tittered. &ldquo;Shall our end be as exemplary?&rdquo; Ruth asked, pensive,
      &ldquo;or will it fade away into chill and nothingness&mdash;like the glory of
      this,&rdquo; she smiled at Pontycroft, &ldquo;April afternoon? B-r-r-r&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
       She gave a little shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft pulled himself to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said he. He proffered two white garments which lay over the
      back of a chair to Ruth and to his sister. &ldquo;What are these melancholy
      sentiments? Aren't you contented? Aren't you satisfied, aren't you pleased
      here?&rdquo; he asked, and he eyed Ruth inquisitorially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&mdash;oh yes, I am,&rdquo; Ruth quickly assured him. &ldquo;But I do get, now
      and then, tiresome conscientious scruples. In these halcyon hours I wonder
      if it isn't my duty to go and have a look at my dear old uncle, all alone
      there, in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;my dear Ruth!&rdquo; cried Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't your 'dear old uncle' come and have a look at you? I think
      it's <i>his</i> duty to do so; I've thought so for many a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's bound to his fireside, I suppose,&rdquo; Ruth answered, a touch of
      melancholy in her voice. &ldquo;He's wedded to his chimney corner, his books. At
      seventy-two it's a bore, perhaps, to go wandering into foreign parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foreign parts!&rdquo; Lucilla cried with some scorn. &ldquo;Are we Ogres? Barbarians?
      Do we live in the Wilds of America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear infant, beware,&rdquo; cautioned Pontycroft, &ldquo;beware of the
      rudiments in your nature of that terrible New England instrument of
      torture, the Nonconformist Conscience. Despite your Catholic upbringing it
      will, if you indulge it, I fear, lead you to your ruin. The Nonconformist
      conscience, I beg you to believe, makes cowards of us all. Now I should
      suggest a much better plan, and one I have always approved of. Let's <i>pack
      up our duds</i>, as the saying goes, in your country; let's return to sane
      and merry England; let us for the future and since the pinch of Winter is
      at our heels, Summer in the South and Winter in the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England?&rdquo; gasped Lucilla and Ruth in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; enquired the man of the family. &ldquo;You are, after all, never so
      comfortable anywhere, in Winter, as in an English Country House. Roaring
      fires, invisible hot-water pipes; cozy dark days, libraries full of books,
      Mudie by post two hours away. Wassailing and Christmas waits; holly and
      mistletoe, hey for an English winter, sing I! Plum pudding, mince pies,
      tenants to tip, neighbours, hospitalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Lucilla wailed, &ldquo;Perish the awful thought! Neighbours 'calling in
      sensible, slightly muddy boots' (as your favourite author too truthfully
      has it), in tweeds and short skirts;&mdash;and for conversation&mdash;Heaven
      defend us! The turnip crops, the Pytchley, penny readings, and the latest
      gossip anent a next-door neighbour. Night all the day&mdash;night again at
      night&mdash;and whisky-and-soda at eleven, day or night,&mdash;eternally
      variegated by that boring, semper-eternal Bridge. You'll have to go
      without me,&rdquo; declared Lucilla flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you generally Wintered in the North, Summered in the South?&rdquo; Ruth
      queried with a gleam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;No,&mdash;&rdquo; replied Pontycroft reflectively, &ldquo;no,&mdash;but if
      one hasn't really tried it since one's callow days the idea does speak to
      one. It isn't all beautiful prattle,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;but the idea does
      appeal to one. As one grows old one prefers to be comfortable. A pabulum
      of beauty is all very well for young things like yourself here and Lucilla
      who still hug the precious foolish delusion that Beauty is Truth, Truth
      Beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft's indolent glance encompassed Florence,&mdash;that fair
      spectacle she presents, in the aura of twilight,&mdash;the exquisite hour,
      <i>l'heure exquise</i>. Her amphitheatre of hills,&mdash;her white villas,
      even now charged with rose by the evening glow,&mdash;aglow her churches,
      her gardens and black cypresses. &ldquo;Yet this is all too like,&rdquo; he commented,
      &ldquo;the enchanter's dream,&mdash;at a puff!... No! Fact, Fact, solid Fact is
      the desideratum! Fact's your miracle in a nutshell. What you and Lucilla
      call Truth alters with every fresh discovery of man, his climate,
      education, point of view. Man carries your Beauty in his eye, ears,
      senses. But Fact, humanly speaking, Fact doesn't give you the least
      trouble. There it is. Did it never occur to you how splendidly reposeful a
      fact it is that a turnip field's a turnip field, until you sow beans to
      rejuvenate it? And here's another, equally comforting: The spider spins
      its web from its own vitals. Ah, Facts spare one such a deal of thinking,
      such a lot of enthusiasm!... In your country, my dear young thing,&rdquo;
       Pontycroft turned to Ruth, &ldquo;in your strange, weird, singular,
      incomprehensible country they sow buckwheat cakes when the turf on the
      lawn's been killed by frosts; and when the buckwheat cakes have grown, and
      blossomed&mdash;they plough them back into the earth, and sow their grass&mdash;and
      in a month you have your velvet robe again. In similar manner the fact
      that a cozy English Winter's a cozy English Winter is one agreeably worthy
      your attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This flummery of rose bushes,&rdquo; went on Pontycroft, while his arm
      described a semicircle,&mdash;&ldquo;this romance of nodding trees laden with
      oranges ornamental to the landscape; this volubility of heliotrope,
      mimosa, violets in January, all, all&mdash;in a conspiracy to lure one to
      sit out o' doors and catch an internal, infernal chill,&rdquo; he sneezed; &ldquo;all
      this taken together is not worth that one fine solid indisputable British
      Fact, a comfortable English Winter! Uncompromising cold without, cheer
      within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's not Winter yet,&rdquo; Lucilla argued plaintively, &ldquo;it's only October.
      Hadn't you better apply the fact of an overcoat to what you've been
      telling us? You've plunged <i>me</i> into anything but a state of cheer
      with your sophistries&mdash;this absurd juggling with the doleful joys of
      an English Winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Apropos</i> of the joys of an English Winter, I wonder whether the
      post has come?&rdquo; said Ruth, jumping up. &ldquo;Pietro's delicacy about disturbing
      us at tea Lucilla won't call mere laziness. I'll send him for your
      overcoat,&rdquo; she added, with a laughing nod, and vanished through the French
      windows.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&mdash;you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft after Ruth's departure ponderated thus on the tone of
      significance, to his sister. &ldquo;Ah, ha! You see.... She's eager for news.
      She's expecting something.... She's on the watch for every post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite off the scent, Harry,&rdquo; returned his sister languidly.
      Lucilla, it was plain, was still disturbed by her brother's chaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's her uncle's semi-annual missive she's so eagerly on the lookout for.
      The child nourishes a perfect hero-worship for the old man; she writes to
      him six times to his one. His letters come with military precision, once
      in a six month. They're invariably brief, and they invariably wind up with
      this hospitable apophthegm, 'Remember the string's on the latchet of the
      door whenever you choose to pull it. Whenever you care to look upon your
      home in Oldbridge you will find a hearty welcome from your affectionate
      uncle,' then a sabre thrust, his name,&mdash;presumably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla rose, with that languid grace she was so famous for. She went to
      the edge of the terrace and leaned upon the balustrade, where she
      remained, silently taking in her fill of the peaceful landscape.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ten minutes elapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft, in silence, smoked and wafted the rings of his cigarette
      towards Florence. And then Ruth reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked pale in the dusk, agitated. In her hands were a couple of
      letters, she held out one to Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo;&mdash;her voice trembled,&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me what I have done to be
      so insulted,&rdquo; she commanded; and then she turned away her face, and
      suddenly she began to weep. Pontycroft watched her in consternation. He
      had never, in all the years he had known her, he had never seen Ruth in
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla took the letter, blazoned with a gold crown. She read down the
      page, she turned over to the next, she read on to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see it?&mdash;May I see it, Ruth?&rdquo; Pontycroft asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth bowed her head. As Pontycroft read she looked at him, her hands lying
      idly in her lap; and she saw his face cloud as he read. But he, having
      finished the communication, fell silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bertram!&rdquo; he let fall at last, dropping the letter upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Poor</i> Bertram!&rdquo; cried Ruth. She dabbed her eyes, she made an
      immense, unsuccessful effort to control herself, quell the ire in her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Bertram!&rdquo; she broke forth scornfully. &ldquo;What have I done, <i>what can
      I have done</i>, to be subjected to such an indignity? Did I lead him on?
      If I had encouraged him! Lucilla, speak, speak the truth. You both know I
      did nothing of the sort!&rdquo; And Ruth stamped her foot. &ldquo;Has the Heir
      Apparent to that obscure little Principality called Altronde had any
      encouragement from me of any kind?... Notwithstanding his visits here,
      notwithstanding the amusement you've had at my expense!&rdquo; Ruth looked
      wrathfully at Pontycroft. &ldquo;And this, this deliberate, this detestable,
      this cold-blooded proposition. And you can say '<i>Poor</i> Bertram'!&rdquo; But
      then she fell to sobbing violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla flew to her, folded protecting arms about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, dear, don't feel so.... Darling! I don't wonder, I do not
      wonder!... But after all, for him, it is an impossible predicament. He is
      to be pitied. You can do nothing better than to feel sorry for him. He's
      madly in love with you,&mdash;that's too evident. Presently you'll be able
      to laugh at it,&mdash;at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Laugh</i> at it?&rdquo; Ruth cried. &ldquo;Ah, how lightly it hits you! Laugh at
      it?... I shall never laugh at it, I shall never laugh at it. I can shudder
      and wonder at the monstrous pride it reveals, the arrogance of a little
      Princeling called to reign over his obscure little Principality.&rdquo; She drew
      herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is that dear old uncle of mine,&rdquo; said she, tightening her clasp upon
      the letter she still held in her hand,&mdash;&ldquo;My uncle, who writes to me
      for the ninetieth time: 'The string is on the latchet of the door, why not
      come and pay a visit to your old home, have a look at your ancestral
      acres'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth rather hysterically, &ldquo;I <i>will</i> go and have a
      look at my ancestral acres! And these Wohenhoffens, these Bertrandoni, who
      are they to fancy themselves privileged to offer me a morganatic marriage
      with their son? But I execrate them! I execrate everything they represent!
      I, Ruth Adgate, to have been exposed to it!&rdquo; And now, again, she began to
      sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft looked exceedingly distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you may believe that Lucilla and I never
      remotely dreamed of this dénouement. I'm not in the least surprised at
      your indignation,&mdash;your horror,&mdash;but I am not in the least
      surprised, either, that poor Bertram, in the tangle of his environment,
      with his tradition, and impelled by a hopeless passion (oh, my prophetic
      eye), did what he could, has written offering you the only honourable
      thing he could offer you, a morganatic marriage. Absurd, outrageous though
      this sounds to you, it is a legal marriage, and remember that the poor
      chap's in a hole, a dreadful box. Shed rather a pitying tear upon his
      blighted young affections.... He can't hope to have you, knew probably how
      you'd take his offer, but he gritted his teeth and made it like the wholly
      decent chap he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I would even wax pathetic,&rdquo; continued Pontycroft, &ldquo;when I think of
      him. Could any fate be more depressing than his? <i>You'll</i> never speak
      to him again! While he, poor fellow, is doomed to marry some sallow Grand
      Duchess for the sake of the Dynasty. Farewell love, farewell comradry,
      farewell all the nice, easy-going businesses of life. Buck up and be a
      Crown Prince! Become a puppet, a puppet on exhibition to your subjects.
      Whatever you like to do that's gay, that's human, debonair,&mdash;you'll
      have to do it on the sly as though it were a sin, or overcome mountains of
      public censure. In fact, whether you please yourself or whether you don't&mdash;the
      majority will always find fault with you. Poor Bertram, I say, poor old
      Bertram.... His proud Wohenhoffen of a mother is the only member of that
      Royal trio, I fancy, who is thoroughly pleased with the new order of
      affairs, for Civillo will soon be making matters hot for himself if he
      doesn't turn over a new leaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ruth dried her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right when you talked of wintering in the North, Harry,&rdquo;
       she said at length, still somewhat tremulous. &ldquo;It doesn't seem as though
      in the North this could possibly have happened. I think you know,&rdquo; she
      took Lucilla's hand, &ldquo;I think I shall try wintering in the North&mdash;I'll
      accept my uncle's invitation; I'll pull the string on the latchet, I'll go
      and have a look at the old man and at my bleak New England acres. After
      all,&rdquo; added Ruth, with rather a wan smile, &ldquo;I suppose it's something to
      have acres, though one has never realised the fact or thought of it
      before. I haven't an idea what mine are like, but it will be good to walk
      on them, to feel I've got them. Here I'm always made to feel such a
      plebeian.&mdash;Yes, I'm <i>made</i> to feel such a plebeian. Oh no, not
      by you,&rdquo; Ruth clasped Lucilla's hand and looked affectionately, a trifle,
      too, defiantly towards Pontycroft, &ldquo;but they all seem to think, even the
      rather ordinary ones, like Mrs. Wilberton and Stuart Seton, an American
      exists to be patronised. No pedigree. An American! Well, who knows,
      perhaps I have a pedigree. I'll go at least where I can't be patronised,
      where they know about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft gave a laugh, which rang not altogether gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, Miss Adgate must have her experience,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate's had all she wants of the old world.&mdash;She must be on
      with the new. Besides, her pride's been wounded.... A prince has offered
      her matrimony, morganatic but honourable marriage. That won't do for her.
      She's wounded in her feelings, outraged by the suggestion, and she
      includes the whole of Europe in her resentment. <i>Oh, my dear young lady</i>&rdquo;
       said Pontycroft after another moment's silence, &ldquo;don't talk to me of
      pride! You Americans are the devil for pride. Ruth, you've been toadied to
      and you fancy you've been patronised.... Well, well, have your experience.
      What great results from little causes flow! Prove to us that you're not
      only as good but a great deal better than any of us. We poor humble folk,
      we'll submit to anything, if when you've had your experience and are
      satisfied, you'll come back to us. But you don't mean it, you don't mean
      it! Or, if you go you'll return, you'll not forsake your adopted country,
      your father's friends, your's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's eyes darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you always, both of you, been too good to me?&rdquo; she cried,
      reproachfully. &ldquo;Ever since I was a little child, you and Lucilla, you know
      that you two have been, ever shall be, in my heart of hearts. But I must
      get away from all this; I must do something!... I must find myself!&rdquo; she
      cried. &ldquo;Say what you will, think what you like, this proposition is too
      loathsome. It has opened my eyes to so many things I had only felt,
      before! It may be all a question of wounded pride, as you say, but I know
      it's the proper sort of pride. I've seen it now, the whole, whole,
      unfriendly situation, in a flash. Lucilla,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;you'll
      sympathise with me; you won't condemn me if I go, you'll never think I
      love you an ounce the less?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla stroked Ruth's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the thing's a sheer incredible bolt out of the blue,
      incredible! I believe,&rdquo; she said, rounding upon her brother, &ldquo;I believe
      it's the outcome of Pontycroft's foolish talk,&mdash;the result of his
      passion for being paradoxical or perish. Here we were&mdash;having our
      teas quite innocently in the garden, like the dear nice people we are,&mdash;perfectly
      happy, absolutely content,&mdash;as why shouldn't we be in this paradise?&rdquo;
       Lucilla opened her blue eyes wide upon the landscape and glanced
      accusingly at Pontycroft. &ldquo;But you've precipitated us into a mess,&rdquo; she
      said to him, &ldquo;with your ribald talk about wintering in our water-soaked
      British Islands. Then comes this ridiculous letter,&mdash;and, of course,
      Ruth can't sit still under it. Yes, it is perhaps after all, a wholesome
      notion of yours, Ruth, a visit to your own country. It's the best bath you
      can take to wash out the taste left by Bertram's well-meant but
      preposterous letter. Besides,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;you'll come back to us!
      America can't gobble you up for ever. But what shall we do without you!&mdash;And
      as for Harry, I feel sorry for him. He'll find no one to give him the
      change when he's in the mood for teasing, no one to keep him in his proper
      place. He'll become unbearable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; fleered Pontycroft, &ldquo;if Ruth forsakes us I will go back to <i>my</i>
      native land! I'll go where I can toast my shins before my fireside and
      experience the solid comforts of a British Winter.... I'll go home to my
      duties, go where I can worry my tenants, read Mudie the livelong day; feel
      that I, too, am somebody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth smiled, rather forlornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to observe,&rdquo; Pontycroft with mock contrition enlarged, &ldquo;how
      one evil deed begets a quantity of others&mdash;a congeries of miseries
      out of which, at last, good springeth like the flowering beanstalk. In
      idle hour (mark the magic potency of words), I speak of wintering in the
      North. Now as you've been told more than once,&mdash;idleness is the
      parent of wickedness. Lucilla assures me that in my paradoxical idleness I
      am a parent to a quite unexpected degree. Now observe,&mdash;the offer of
      a morganatic marriage follows speedily on the heels of my sin, the sin of
      an idle paradox. Then Ruth becomes guilty of the sin of anger&mdash;tossing
      her pretty head and stamping her pretty foot, she declares she won't play
      in our yard any longer. She stamps her pretty foot and announces she's
      going back to her own New England apple orchard. The rudiments of her
      Nonconformist, New England conscience, thoroughly roused,&mdash;her
      thoughts fly towards home and her aged uncle. In my remorse, I, in virtue
      not to be outdone, decide to go back to my duties. Lucilla,
      conventionalised British matron that <i>au fond</i> she is, spite of her
      protests, already, because she must, assembles to her soul her list of
      social obligations at Dublin, the frocks to plan, and the dinner parties
      to give prior to the coming out and Presentation at Court of her eldest
      child. Home, home, home,&rdquo; murmured Pontycroft, &ldquo;sweet home is the tune
      we'll all be whistling within a month. Lucilla will carol it from her bog
      because it isn't considered polite to whistle in Ireland; but I, from my
      Saxon heath and Ruth from God's country will imitate the blackbirds. Could
      any tune be more acceptable to the Nonconformist conscience? Ruth, you
      perceive, already begins to dominate! Columbia, Ruler of the sea and wave&mdash;see
      how she sends us about our neglected and obvious affairs. High-ho for
      Winter in the North,&rdquo; said Ponty. &ldquo;But meantime I'm going to array myself
      for dinner and here comes Pietro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven for the trivialities of life,&rdquo; Lucilla put in with fervour.
      &ldquo;Ruth, shall we don our best gowns in honour of the unexpected? Harry may
      dub this the call to duty; I know it's never anything so dull. I know that
      the spirit of adventure he's hailed has seized upon both of you, is
      lifting us all, will-he nill-he, out of our beautiful <i>dolce far niente</i>
      into something restless, violent, and tiresome. As for me&mdash;there's
      nothing, naught left for me, poor me! to do but to follow your lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by all means,&rdquo; Ruth lightly acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll put our best frocks on; and let us hope the call to duty decked in
      purple and fine linen, masquerading as the spirit of adventure, may lead
      us up to consummations....&rdquo; She broke off. &ldquo;Devoutly to be wished for,&rdquo;
       she whispered to herself under her breath.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'm to be made the arbiter of other destinies when my own are more
      than I can manage&rdquo; (they were dallying over figs and apricots at
      breakfast)&mdash;&ldquo;pray, you two good people tell me, kindly, when shall we
      begin to throw our bonnets over the mill? In other words, on what day and
      in what month do we start in search of Winter in the North?&rdquo; Ruth
      enquired, to a feint of cheerfulness and little dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to-morrow&mdash;To-morrow, if you like,&rdquo; jerked Pontycroft. &ldquo;Wait not
      upon the order of your going, but start at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start to-morrow!&rdquo; Lucilla cried, &ldquo;start to-morrow? Impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why impossible? Nothing is impossible. Ruth wants to go. She said so last
      night, she more than hints it, to-day. What woman wants, God wants.&rdquo;
       Oblivious to the truth that a woman, his sister, panted to remain,
      Pontycroft glanced at the newspaper at his elbow. &ldquo;A steamer sails from
      Genoa tomorrow afternoon, the <i>Princess Irene</i>. I'll go down to
      Humbert's this moment as ever is,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and have them wire for a
      deck cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Lucilla. &ldquo;Why leave all this loveliness at once?
      Impossible! Besides, we have people coming to dinner tomorrow,&rdquo; she
      remembered hopefully. &ldquo;Thursday. The Newburys and young Worthington. We
      can't put them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can, and we shall,&rdquo; asseverated Ponty. &ldquo;There's nothing so dreadful,
      Lucilla, as these long superfluous drawn-out farewells, these impending
      good-byes. Send Pietro, if you like, to say we've all responded to a call
      of duty. Tell your friends in all charity, that when duty calls the wise
      youth replies: 'I <i>won't</i>.' Why?... Because he knows that nine times
      out of ten duty is only what somebody else thinks he ought to be doing.
      But tell them duty's only skin deep, by way of advice. Tell them one's
      response to duty is generally the mere weak living up to somebody else's
      good opinion of one. Say to them: 'Vanity, vanity, all is vanity.' But say
      that in this case it's otherwise&mdash;we're not wise, and we've answered
      with one accord: '<i>I will</i>.' Say to them that therein lies our folly.&mdash;We're
      exceedingly sorry&mdash;sorry, but we must be off. It shall be a seven
      days' wonder, Florence shall have something to talk about. She needs
      brisking up. Ruth, I'm off to engage your passage. The sooner you go, the
      sooner you'll come back to tell us all about it,&mdash;tell us whether the
      play was worth the candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ponty rang for his stick and his hat, lighted the inevitable cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paolina will pack you up, Ruth, if she has to keep busy until midnight,&rdquo;
       he directed, between two puffs. &ldquo;Lucilla, Pietro can help Maria with your
      paraphernalia; when I'm back here with our tickets he'll be half through
      the packing. Lazy duffer though he be, once he begins, he's rapid as
      radium.&rdquo; Ponty was gone before either Lucilla or Ruth could protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another.... What ludicrous extravagance of sudden
      breaking up! This high-handed method of bringing matters summarily to a
      climax struck them both. Lucilla and Ruth broke into peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irresponsible sun glared&mdash;into their eyes&mdash;played,
      flamboyant among the glass and silverware of the breakfast table; it
      winked in prismatic rays from crystal angles of honey pots and threw its
      splashes of blinding light over the damask table cloth, borrowing rosy
      tints from a mass of pink geranium in a bowl of Nagasaki ware. It glanced
      at all the polished surfaces of the old carved oak furniture; the room was
      one flagrant and joyous outburst of morning sunlight, the garden an
      invitation to come out, come out and play, and enjoy life from its
      inception! Elusive, dewy, odorous lovelinesses rested upon it, mounted
      from it, entreated you to step under the trees, wander among growing
      tender things, bathed all in a dew and glister. And called to you to come
      and loiter,&mdash;and mark the passage of Aurora and her maidens, hours
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just a trifle odd to be swept off one's feet in this
      whoop-and-begone-with-you manner,&rdquo; Ruth, with half a laugh, half a sob,
      commented. &ldquo;Maugre the thing's to be sooner rather than later, Lucilla, I
      can't see though why <i>my</i> going should mean yours, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear infant,&rdquo; Lucilla answered, tenderly, &ldquo;don't worry.... Whatever
      should Ponty and myself do here alone? We'd get on one another's nerves in
      a week and part in a temper. Since things have happened as they have,
      things are better as they are; leave them to hammer out their own
      salvation. Things, <i>I</i> find, are very like the little sheep in Mother
      Goose. You let them alone and they come home, wagging their tails behind
      them.... But oh, oh, oh,&rdquo; sighed Lucilla, &ldquo;how I adore this! How I would
      stay here forever! It is a blow,&rdquo; her voice was vibrant of regret....
      &ldquo;But, of course, Harry's right, he's always right. Shall we obey orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;es,&rdquo; said Ruth. She felt a tightening at her heart, a sudden lump
      in her throat. The glory of the October morning had all at once
      departed.... A decided glamour enveloped the project of a visit to her
      uncle. Moreover, her heart drew her to him. The fine sense of an affront
      she must fly from had, too, gathered strength in the night; the indignity
      put upon her by Bertram's letter she must resent. Her pride protested
      fiercely, she must retaliate even though Ponty should express to Bertram
      her thanks with refusal of the honour conferred upon her. But now these
      emotions were quelled by an unspeakable depression, a loneliness, a sense
      of isolation, of dread, a dread of the Unknown.... The dread swept her off
      her feet. Dread of something more, too.... How was she,&mdash;how was she,
      Ruth Adgate,&mdash;to live away from these two people? To-morrow would
      mark the beginning of an ocean rolled up between her old life and the new
      one she would be journeying towards. To-morrow! to-morrow! To-morrow would
      see the end, for how many, many dreary months, of this beauty laden,
      gracious existence; the camaraderie of these two people whom she had
      reason to love best in the world, at whose side she had grown up,&mdash;Lucilla
      and Henry Pontycroft, whom she understood, who understood her!
      Instinctively, she felt she was electing for herself a grimmer fate, a
      sterner life and land, than any she had known, could dimly divine....
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the glory of the April morning had departed into chill and
      nothingness. It might have already been December though it was only
      October, and Pontycroft had gone to buy her ticket. The first, the
      irremediable step was taken. She must put the best face she could upon
      this adventure of her choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla, to whom Ruth and her thoughts were transparent as flies in amber,
      put her arms about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;it's because he can't bear the parting, the
      thought of it. It's going to be a horrible break for him. What we'll
      either of us do when you're no longer within reach, when you are no longer
      part of our daily life, I can't imagine. I can't imagine any of it without
      you, and neither of us will want this, without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's eyes glowed. Bending forward she kissed Lucilla, and they marched
      away, arm-inarm, to do their packing.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parting is such sweet sorrow,&rdquo; sighed Juliet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl of fourteen saw in the act an excuse for endless impassioned
      kisses. The world-worn poet Haraucourt better understood the disastrous
      effect of saying good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Partir</i>&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;<i>c'est mourir un feu!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave, to part, is to die a little.&rdquo; Unless, indeed, death be a more
      desirable state than life,&mdash;as who in this world can possibly affirm,
      or deny,&mdash;except our Holy Mother Church?&mdash;It were safer then,
      never to leave, never to part. This is perhaps the true course of wisdom,
      to live in the same spot, content with the same people. They, after all,
      are sure to be exceedingly like the people one will find elsewhere; and,
      ten to one, prove to be verily rather nicer, as experience is apt to show.
      Yet Juliet and Haraucourt are agreed upon one point; parting, whether to
      the accompaniment of kisses or of death, a little,&mdash;parting is a
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting of their ways, to the three occupants of Villa Santa Cecilia,
      was poignant. To each, after his kind the next twenty-four hours were
      inexpressibly distressing. Ponty got through them stoically and worked off
      some of his feelings in an unconscionable and conscienceless number of
      cigarettes. Lucilla wept and prayed. Ruth said very little and directed
      her packing in a suffocation of heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train passed out from the station at Florence, bearing her with
      Pontycroft towards Genoa, Ruth's tears gushed like fountains of water. Nor
      did she in the least try to conceal her distress from Ponty who sat
      quietly regarding the landscape from the other side of the compartment. It
      had been arranged that he should return for Lucilla, thus giving to that
      lady a welcome day's grace, when Ruth had been safely handed over to the
      Bolingbrokes, friends of Lucilla, a young Secretary from the British
      Embassy in Rome and his bride, on their way out, to Washington. Their
      names Ponty had, with relief, discovered among the list, at Humbert's of
      the ship's passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The varied, finished, complex Tuscan landscape passed all leisurely before
      their eyes; the olive groves, the orange-pink willows; the white streams
      romping under grey arches; the villages, the mediaeval cytties, scattered
      by the way, the rose-coloured or white monasteries and villas on the
      sun-decked hillsides. From the little old churches and campaniles of the
      plain, from the convents perched far above them, innumerable silvery peals
      of chimes came floating, in tune, out of tune, it mattered not. As a
      matter of fact, they were shockingly out of tune; the quality of the
      Tuscan air is, however, so extraordinary an embellisher of sound as well
      as of scene, that all sounds become harmonious, even as every scene
      arranges itself into a primitive picture, thanks to this most beautifying
      of mediums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I leave it, how <i>can</i> I leave it?&rdquo; Ruth was saying to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, I think I'm a goose,&rdquo; she let fall at last, smiling at
      Pontycroft through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet child,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, &ldquo;we must aye live and learn! And you're
      so young that living and learning may still be supposed to hold elements
      of interest. There's a lot ahead of you that's new and strange, so dry
      your pretty eyes, and <i>Sursum Corda</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul misgives me that the new and strange will contain nothing
      approaching to this,&rdquo; Ruth said, nodding her head towards the window. &ldquo;And
      I don't think I shall like doing without it,&rdquo; she added plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's country,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, &ldquo;won't look like this, to be sure, nor
      give you a single blessed one of these fine emotions, these raptures. But
      after all, it's the first wrench that costs, says the prophet, and since
      we're not here entirely, he assures us, to amuse ourselves, a visit to
      God's country may prove a salutary if bitter pill to a young lady
      surfeited with the sweets of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dio mio,&rdquo; Ruth cried, &ldquo;since when has Pontycroft turned moralist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the hour he was made to realise the fatal effects of reckless
      paradox,&rdquo; Ponty answered, with mock solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell to chaffing one another as naturally as possible and the time
      flew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Genoa la Suferba, Genoa la Suferba!</i> How perfectly, how radiantly
      the word describes her fits her,&rdquo; murmured Ruth when, after a succession
      of tunnels, in the early afternoon, the sumptuous town burst upon them.
      The dazzling town, her flashing panoply of palaces, villas, gardens,
      churches, mounting up, and up&mdash;her hill, leaning firmly against the
      background of blue skies, blue as the Virgin Mary's robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The imagination, the purpose, in those lines of architecture, those
      formal gardens!&rdquo; cried Ruth. &ldquo;How daring, uncompromising, beauty is in
      this land of Italy. And see, the Mediterranean, all sparkle and laughter
      there at her feet!&rdquo; She leaned forward; then fell back against the
      cushions, savouring with heart as well as eyes the brilliant vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train hammered heavily into the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ge&mdash;no&mdash;a! Ge&mdash;no&mdash;a!&rdquo; The nasal cry reverberated
      through the glass-covered dome. There was noisy confusion of opening
      carriage doors, of passengers descending, calling, embracing, greeting; of
      porters running hither and yon; of trucks of luggage blocking the way amid
      a commotion of officialdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth stood quietly in the uproar, and gazed upon it, and at Ponty's lank
      figure, while he dealt with the business of the occasion. Her heart was
      beating tumultuously. She felt a violent impulse to run away and hide
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beginning of the end,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is the beginning of the end.
      Why have I done this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she had shaken hands with the Bolingbrokes; she was saying
      good-bye to Pontycroft from the window of the carriage which was to take
      her, with her new acquaintances, to the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth's sympathetic Italian maid, waiting and watching in the background,
      in a hack laden with luggage, murmured to herself: &ldquo;<i>Pover a, Poverella!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ruth, in a misery of wild light-headedness, responded as well as she could
      to the civilities of her two travelling companions, while they drove
      through narrow, animated streets. They reached the docks. There lay the
      massive ship, its relentless black hulk resting abroadside, in ominous
      expectation of some mysterious coming change. Ruth walked up the white
      gangway. The turmoil, the excited crowd, the stolid stewards,&mdash;lolling,&mdash;indifferent
      yet curious sentinels,&mdash;the ragged throng of emigrants passing
      endlessly into the forecastle, the noise of clanking wains and girders
      hoisting trunks and freight into mid air, all, gave to her a sense of
      doom, of the finality of things in chaos.... Half an hour passed before
      she was able to go to her room. Telegrams were handed to her, even
      flowers, fruit; thus rapidly does news spread; she had to talk with
      friends of the Bolingbrokes come to bid them God-speed, to look pleasant
      and pleased as everybody else did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at last Ruth closed the door of her cabin behind her, she took a
      little step forward and with a cry threw herself upon the couch.
      Regardless of Paolina, who was already opening bags and unfolding dresses,
      she permitted herself the luxury of a passionate outburst of grief. A
      tornado of pent misery racked her; she pressed her face into the linen
      pillow to deaden the sound of her sobbing, her hands against her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorina, Signorina, do not feel so badly,&rdquo; cried the good Italian maid,
      dropping Ruth's lace and beribboned morning gown and running towards her.
      &ldquo;Oh, do not weep. It is very sad to have to leave our lovely Italian land,
      so beautiful, so <i>carina</i>. But do not weep so! What will the Signora
      Dor say if I allow you to make yourself ill? Think! It is I who should be
      weeping. It is I who am leaving all behind me, my country, my sister, my
      mother, and yet I do not weep.&rdquo; But the tears belied her words and welled
      from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth clasped the girl's hand affectionately. She felt grateful for the
      warm Italian heart. Paolina at least was there, to keep her recollected in
      the exquisite life she was forsaking. Why she was forsaking it, now seemed
      to her an absolutely incomprehensible riddle. For the nonce she could
      remember not one of her substantial reasons for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paolina withdrew the pins from Ruth's hat, removed it from her hair and
      put it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have crushed your pretty hat, Signorina,&rdquo; she said, reproachfully.
      Then, very much in the tone a mother would use to distract a child:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not see how pale the Signor Pontycroft looked when he said
      good-bye,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and Maria told me the Signora had not slept the
      whole night, but kept going constantly to your door and listening to know
      whether you were asleep. They love you very much. It must be good to be
      loved so much,&rdquo; the girl continued wistfully. &ldquo;That must comfort you. And
      you will soon come back to them, to Italy, when you have seen your Signor
      uncle and your American home&mdash;for I am very sure they cannot live
      without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Paolina, I am so unhappy,&rdquo; Ruth said, simply. &ldquo;But leave me,&rdquo; she
      smiled to the girl through her tears, &ldquo;I will call you when I feel
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paolina turned to go, then came back, lifted Ruth's hand, kissed it. &ldquo;I
      hope you will pardon me, Signorina,&rdquo; she added shyly, &ldquo;<i>Scusi</i>, if I
      say, we must always smile, it pleases God better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Paolina left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while, Ruth, quite still, battled with her feelings. A fresh
      passion of grief overtook her.... When at last it had spent itself, she
      drew her Rosary, which she carried in the gold bag in her hand, from its
      sheath. Slowly, the sweetness of the five decades passed into her spirit,
      she felt comforted. Peace filled her heart. There was only, now and then,
      the ache, where before there had been uncontrollable despair. She stood
      up, bathed her face, rang for Paolina, and began removing the
      tortoise-shell pins from her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paolina,&rdquo; she cried, as the maid entered the room. &ldquo;Paolina,&rdquo; she twisted
      her hair again into its thick coil, &ldquo;we are going to enjoy ourselves now!
      No more tears, no more regrets. You are quite right. We must smile to the
      good God if we wish Him to smile on us! Make haste and give me a short
      skirt and a warm coat, and my cap and veil. I long to get out and breathe
      the air and fill my eyes with a sight of the shores of Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner and during the rest of the evening, as they steamed down the
      coast towards Naples, Ruth was an irresistible <i>precis</i> of smiles and
      vivacity. The Bolingbrokes were captivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; the young Mrs. Bolingbroke told her lord when they were alone
      together, &ldquo;that Miss Adgate is a most charmin' girl. What was that
      nonsense Mrs. Wilberton retailed about her runnin' away from Henry
      Pontycroft whom she's hopelessly in love with? She is in love with no man!
      You can't deceive me!&rdquo; Mrs. Bolingbroke cried gaily. &ldquo;It's easy to see
      from the fun she's positively bubblin' over with that her heart isn't
      weighted by any hopeless passion. She's never been in America before she
      says, and it's the great adventure of her life.... She's goin' to visit an
      old uncle, whom she's never seen but adores. Her childlike enjoyment of
      doin' it quite alone (she has her maid with her) and her eagerness about
      it, is quite fascinatin'. Although she is so rich, she's evidently seen
      very little of the world,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bolingbroke, who happened to be a
      year Ruth's junior, but had the feeling of knowing the world thoroughly
      from within and from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her husband answered guardedly; he remembered that a First
      Secretary must show diplomatic reticence in his judgments, even to his
      wife. &ldquo;Yes, Miss Adgate does seem rather a decent sort. I dare say the
      story is all a fabrication. She does seem a nice sort of unsophisticated
      young creature and I dare say the story's all a fabrication. Just the
      pretty charitable way people have of talking. I can see no objection to
      your enjoying as much of her society as you like, Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that safe in her husband's blessing upon the friendship,
      Mrs. Bolingbroke, all unsuspected by Ruth, became her champion.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>N Indian summer
      day, idle and tender, lay over hills and woods, meadows, river. The quaint
      little Old Town of Oldbridge, set among apple orchards and gardens and
      avenues of elms, received this last Benediction of Nature with an
      agreeable <i>ouf!</i> of respite from imminent grim winter approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to account, by any utilitarian motive on the part of our
      &ldquo;brown and green old Mother Earth,&rdquo; for her November caprice of a New
      England Indian summer, though I make no doubt the scientists will have
      some prosaic reason to give which we are asked to take upon faith. But
      since fruit, in New England, is garnered in September, and the toughest
      plants are burned to a crimson glory by October frosts, no ripened fruit
      or renewal of leaves defend the vagary. And so&mdash;will-he nill-he, we
      praise Heaven which made our &ldquo;bounteous mother&rdquo; feminine forsooth; we
      gratefully credit the enchanted fortnight to her bountiful illogical
      womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Town of Oldbridge, then, basking under the Indian summer's morning
      blandishment while it sipped its mocha and partook of grape-fruit towards
      eight of the clock, pushed an agreeable <i>ouf!</i>&mdash;awake to
      agreeable titillations of excitement. General Adgate's niece, lovely and
      rich, admirable combination&mdash;Miss Adgate (Ruth Adgate, they already
      called her, didn't she belong to them?) had arrived. The event, discreetly
      mentioned in the Oldbridge <i>Morning Herald</i>, stared them in the face.
      Some boasted a glimpse of her, the day before, seated in the brougham
      beside her uncle; a pretty girl with reddish brown hair. Others had seen
      of her nothing but her outward manifestations on the luggage cart&mdash;two
      big brass-bound cork trunks, a cabin trunk, precisely similar, a square
      hat-box, a dressing case and a dark-eyed Italian maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of all work, Jo, brought this luggage into the house, with the
      gardener's assistance, and up to Ruth's rooms. Now he wiped the
      perspiration from his face. Arms akimbo, brows warped in puzzled frown, he
      glared at the encumbrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I be durned!&rdquo; he burst forth. &ldquo;Glad I ain't got any of them things
      to carry round when I go a travelling. One carpet bag's big enough for me,
      when I visit my folks, to Falls Junction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky you're glad,&rdquo; Martha, the efficient, the tart, the very tart
      housemaiden snapped, and put him instantly in his place. &ldquo;Not likely soon,
      we'll catch you towering it with a valet and trunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      As to the unconscious subject of comment and curiosity, Miss Ruth Adgate,&mdash;Miss
      Adgate was ecstatic. Her heart in its rapture wanted to, did, engulf the
      house, and the land and the hill, and the inmates of the Old Adgate place,
      and the entire town of Oldbridge. Something new, something strange had
      indeed happened for her joy had begun to bubble and ferment from the
      moment her foot passed the threshold of the house. No&mdash;from the hour
      the train, on its sideline to Oldbridge, had begun to move beside the
      river, bearing her for thirty minutes from one little way-station to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentiment of an autumnal New England landscape spread beneath clean
      thoughtless blue skies,&mdash;vistas of grey rocks and sedges by the river
      at the one hand,&mdash;where the dark green savins, reminding her of
      cypresses in Italy, sprang through the grey clefts;&mdash;and across the
      river, hills, low, wooded, interspersed with green and brown and orange
      pastures, through which cropped the same venerable grey New England rock,&mdash;harmonious
      and austere,&mdash;this perspective, enchanting in its tonic beauty, was
      grievously, alas! debased and disfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignoble little wooden packing cases liberally dotted by the way screamed
      with the crudest colours, 'the crudest rainbow scale disgorges on the
      palate.' Gigantic hoardings, flaunting ridiculous local remedies and foods
      for every prevalent disease or dyspeptic stomach insolently stared at one;&mdash;the
      very backs and sides of barns and packing cases were decorated with their
      insignia!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They need a Thames Conservancy, a County Council, something,&rdquo; Ruth
      protested to her outraged sense of beauty, &ldquo;to save this splendid river,
      control such unpuritanical abandonments to colour and commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate, you perceive, was naïvely confident&mdash;oh, serene British
      confidence! that taste governs the world, that the world rays and rules so
      soon as the world discovers it is acting in bad taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these blemishes were, after all, insignificant affairs&mdash;details
      incidental to an untutored modern public. What Miss Adgate's inward vision
      vividly perceived through the windows of the shabby long car with its
      soiled velvet cushions, and air of unworldliness,&mdash;which pleased her,&mdash;its
      smell of stale apples and anthracite coal smoke which didn't please her,&mdash;was
      the <i>land</i>. The land without a flaw of commerce! Hidden lives that
      took her blood back three hundred years, led her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeniably, the effect of this country was not one of abundance.... It was
      not varied and enhanced by a thousand fair human touches; the neglected
      land was uncouthly rough.... Nor was it in the least suggestive of the
      poetry, art, emotion,&mdash;the loves, the hates&mdash;of nineteen hundred
      vanished sumptuous years. (One might have likened it rather to the starved
      and simple beggar-maid waiting for the King.) But it was hers, it was <i>hers!</i>...
      She was <i>of it!</i>... Miss Adgate was deliciously cognisant that this
      fact filled her heart to overflowing with sweet content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This land saw my forbears!... This land for three hundred years gave them
      all they asked of life.... It opened its heart to them, therefore I love
      it, therefore I love it!&rdquo; she repeated softly to herself. &ldquo;And if this
      elation is patriotism&mdash;the mere patriotism dubbed Reflex Egotism by
      the cynics,&mdash;well&mdash;poor dears! What dear poor dears the cynics
      be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ruth Adgate gave a pleased sigh and turned her eyes again upon the
      view. They fell upon a bit of grey rock, a group of savins and scarlet
      barberry bushes loitering beside a piece of water... a composition Diaz
      would have thankfully imprinted, for reproduction, on his retina. The
      little pool, from brink to brink, coyly reflected these and the clear blue
      sky, and in the foreground twenty feet of hoarding bore the legend: &ldquo;Try
      Grandpa Luther's Syrup of Winter-green for your Baby's Tantrums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth fell back with rather a rueful laugh.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next station?&mdash;O&mdash;Oldbridge,&rdquo; sang out the cherubic faced
      conductor and Ruth's heart began to palpitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> smile,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I won't be absurd.&rdquo; And she fixed her
      gaze resolutely on the landscape, arrested, at once, by some subtle change
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceptibly, the meadows displayed a softer, more velvety grass; the trees
      grew, more finely luxuriant, the cliffs rose boldly. A hint of human
      intention, the touch of elegance, a something thoroughbred, spoke
      aloud.... The few last miles through which Miss Adgate jolted gave
      symptoms of civilisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;O&mdash;ldbridge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard intoned it nasally, with complete resignation,&mdash;a twenty
      years' fatiguing habit; and an intimation too, in his voice, that the goal
      of human travel had been reached. The train slackened.... One saw,
      spanning the river, a black bridge latticing the green and the blue; one
      caught glimpses of a town, white houses scattered up the slopes of wooded
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several trim white yachts rested on the water; small sailboats glided,
      hither and yon, and little skiffs and slim rowboats floated by to a
      leisurely motion, manned by a single young oarsman, a girl seated hatless,
      in the bow. The gay scene under the yellow sunlight, the rippling, the
      smiling river, the warm waning afternoon&mdash;alive, sparkling, seemed an
      invitation to her full of promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Paolina,&rdquo; said Ruth, with inward trepidation. &ldquo;Come, Paolina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate summoned her courage as the train stopped with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed&mdash;heroic effort&mdash;through the car to the platform,
      while Paolina took the dressing-case and followed, moved like her mistress
      and as tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth scanned the faces in the friendly brick station. The white head, the
      features, familiar from photograph presentment, were&mdash;not there! But
      a hand, extended at the last step to help her descend, caused her to turn.
      Her arms in an instant had flung themselves impulsively about a figure
      which stood at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; cried Ruth. Her heart ceased to pound, her nervousness gave way
      to an immense inward satisfaction. Tears sprang to her eyes&mdash;but,
      what did it matter? My heroine would be less charming were she less
      impressionable and one does not gather upon every bush, an uncle <i>in
      loco parentis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, my dear!&mdash;we've got you here at last, Ruth,&rdquo; said the
      tall, thin, old man. He looked down at her fondly, a good face full of
      kindly scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've brought belongings of sorts?&rdquo; General Adgate enquired as he
      conducted Ruth towards the carriage whilst the young girl felt half a
      dozen pairs of curious eyes fixed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's your maid tell her there's a seat for her in the luggage cart
      near Jobias,&rdquo; said General Adgate. He handed his niece into the brougham,
      Paolina received her instructions, they drove off.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      And for a moment they sped in silence, up a side street, into an open
      square of shops and brick buildings, for all the world like the High
      Street of any English Provincial town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how English it looks!&rdquo; Ruth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it? Why not?&rdquo; said General Adgate. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we pride
      ourselves, further on, that we're distinctively American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brick buildings surely enough dissolved into avenues set with superb
      elms. Big comfortable houses encircled by verandas,&mdash;many adorned
      with those fluted Corinthian columns, mark in Oldbridge of the early
      nineteenth century,&mdash;all snugly set back among flower gardens and
      lawns, emanated peace, prosperity, good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This place must be Arcady in summer.... How charming it is,&rdquo; Ruth cried,
      delighted. &ldquo;These gardens in flower, these trees in leaf&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not so bad,&rdquo; said General Adgate, dryly. &ldquo;Longfellow christened it
      the Rose of New England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we call this the City of Oldbridge,
      a modern matter. You, Ruth, belong to the Court End of the town&mdash;you
      are of what we call the Old Town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vastly amused at the distinction, a Yankee Faubourg Saint Germain, Ruth
      plied him with questions. In five minutes the agreeable news that she,&mdash;the
      last of the house of Adgate in America, Ruth Adgate verily the salt of the
      earth, tracing a clean English ancestry back to the crusades, to mistier
      periods beyond, here held her Yankee acres in grant first from an English
      Sovereign, and, without a drop of blood-shed from Indian Sachems,&mdash;gave
      to her humourous sense of proportion somewhat to smile over.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went,&mdash;under endless prospects of arching elm trees, whose
      branches threw oblique attenuated shadows among the rays of the descending
      sun. A few soft clouds at the horizon were tinted rosy and red. Then the
      very blue, blue sky, suffused with violet and rose, suddenly flared. Far
      and wide, from earth to zenith, far and wide the sky burst into a glorious
      scarlet conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city lay behind, meadows stretched broadly at either side, and to the
      right a pretty line of hill and wood etched itself against the blushing
      clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beginning of your acres, my dear,&rdquo; said the old man, bowing his head.
      &ldquo;There they lie, untouched, just as James the First ceded them to your
      forefathers, just as the Indian Sachems of the Mohegan Tribe confirming
      the gift, withdrew from 'em. The bit of wood there is known to this day as
      the Wigwam and the last Indian hut in this State disappeared when it was
      destroyed by fire a hundred years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had passed a road that wandered into the woodland, they were rolling
      smartly by stone walls that shut in a goodly reach of close-cut lawn all
      seamed and scarred by grey jutments of rock, which rising, mounting,
      reached a hill through terraced gardens trimly laid and skirting the
      summit. The carriage took a sharp sweep upward into a gravelled drive,
      rolled on a few paces, stopped abruptly before a brown, rambling house,&mdash;Miss
      Adgate had reached the end of her journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; said General Adgate, as he helped Ruth to alight. He bent
      down, kissed her, and led her up the steps into the house.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was morning. It was nine of the clock. Miss Adgate walked, alone,
      through a path that penetrated to the Wigwam. Almost hidden by a thicket
      of sweet fern, juniper, barberry and briar which grew at either side,
      which clung too affectionately to her skirts and from which she had
      difficulty in disengaging herself, the path, she thought, might have led
      her to the Palace of The Sleeping Beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning, as I have said, and it was the morning of her first day,
      and early abroad, Miss Adgate strolled in a pleasant sort of reverie,&mdash;thinking
      of nothing, perhaps, or thinking of a number of things. The Indian summer
      sunshine filtered upon her through half-bare branches not quite denuded of
      their yellow and purple and scarlet leafage; and every now and then a leaf
      came fluttering down in the light breeze. A squirrel, now and then, darted
      out along a branch, paused&mdash;and like an Italian lizard, all a-gleam
      and a-whisk, gleamed, whisked, and disappeared. But Ruth knew two little
      black beadlike eyes still watched her, as she went, from behind the
      lattice-screen of twigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and then she passed a formidable, a monumental boulder;
      moss-grown; covered with grey lichen; dropped there by some glacier, æons
      since, unless Heaven, it occurred to her, had placed it where it stood,
      and why not? for picturesque intent?... Every now and then a tardy bluejay
      flitted by, lighted upon a branch and sent forth his imperious <i>cha,
      cha, cha!</i>... Or a woodpecker, in the distance, made his tapping noise
      as he sounded the trees for his meal. A dry twig would break, suddenly,&mdash;come
      tumbling head foremost down, down through a rustle of leaves, and all
      these sounds struck upon Miss Adgate's ears in her reverie, gave her
      exquisite pleasure. She enjoyed the romance and the solitude of this wild
      wood; she delighted in the knowledge that she was walking safely through
      her own preserves; and <i>treve de compliments</i>, her uncle had left her
      upon a brief good-bye after an early breakfast. Ruth burned to discover
      alone, he knew, her domain&mdash;General Adgate had divined it without a
      hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll want to take a walk this morning through your woods, Ruth,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;Cross the hill,&mdash;you'll find a road to the right leading by a
      brook,&mdash;follow the road,&mdash;it takes you over the brook by a
      bridge and soon becomes a path. No one will molest you, it's yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the brook as well?&rdquo; queried she, feeling, somehow, like a very
      little girl in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the brook as well. You can't get away from your preserves,&mdash;they
      stretch on for miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was that Miss Adgate, abroad at nine o'clock, happened to be off for
      a matutinal stroll through paths wet and dewy, glad of her freedom, glad
      to be alone in a new world, surrender herself to the romance of a new
      train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, presently, to a clearing in the wood. The path ended, abruptly,
      at a flat bed of rock which descended for some hundred feet to another
      opening in the wood. There were bayberry and barberry and fern along the
      way, slashed scarlet by the frosts; there were fifty plants she promised
      to herself to learn the names of, which gave forth strong, sweet scents in
      the hot sun. Ruth sat down. A swish, through the dry leaves, a stir of the
      brown grass, told of the frightened escape of some little living thing,
      and set her heart to palpitating unaccountably with love for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mood had become a trifle exalted, her perceptions quickened by her
      promenade. Each insect, bird, bush she came upon began to assume a
      personality; claimed the privilege to live upon her land. She was the
      suzerain of their little lives; she could have held a court of justice;
      she could have dispensed favours, played their games, ruled them, thrown
      herself into their griefs and joys, with heart and soul. Seated here, in
      the warm sun, on the warm stone checked with patches of green and brown
      club-moss, she inhaled the crisp fragrance of the bushes under the sun's
      kisses; she looked afar, on to the trees below and over their heads at the
      vivid sky, and upon faraway violet hills, and upon green and orange, brown
      and guileless meadows. The world seemed good and wonderful, and she felt
      exceedingly content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ruth Adgate who spent twenty years of her life in Europe is no more,&rdquo;
       she thought, lightly. &ldquo;The young person who has tasted most of the sweets
      of European civilisation, walked in marble halls, refused a Duke, run away
      from the outrage offered her dignity by the offer of a morganatic marriage
      with a Crown Prince,&mdash;the lovesick girl who wandered through the
      moonlight at the Lido, floated upon the silent lagoons of Venice,
      discoursed with wits in lovely gardens in Florence, and herself the cause
      of wit in others, hung upon their discourse&mdash;that was quite another
      person! That was but an early incarnation, never the real Miss Adgate. <i>This</i>
      is the real Miss Adgate! In spite of every influence to the contrary,&mdash;the
      product of her native land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla, Pontycroft&mdash;Pontycroft, Lucilla! How far away they
      seemed.... Their names stirred her heart as she pronounced them. But even
      so&mdash;was not this best? The present Miss Adgate in a short skirt, a
      blue, soft felt hat, tip-tilted over her eyes, a stick in her hand, her
      thoughts for all society; Miss Adgate with this hardy New England nature
      for background,&mdash;Ruth Adgate taking a solitary walk upon her own
      land, with the feeling that good will and satisfaction smiled at her
      because of her presence there, was not this the Real person who had found
      her true niche in the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How singular,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;The transformation has taken place
      overnight. It is almost as though I had been here forever! And to-day I
      feel as though I had a destiny&mdash;as though Fate had something up her
      sleeve here for me. I've begun like one of Henry Harland's heroines and
      I'm convinced that whatever the Powers are preparing for me&mdash;I shall
      accept it here,&mdash;just as I accept all this&mdash;gratefully, gaily,
      without demur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth glanced at the violet hills and the guileless meadows and a thrill
      passed through her. She jumped up, a white hand held to shade her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Basta!</i> I've rested long enough, the sun here is too hot,&rdquo; said
      Miss Adgate. &ldquo;I think I'll discover what lies beyond, in the heart of that
      wood there,&rdquo; and off she started, blushing at her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A company of crows in a distant field caw-cawed, querulously, at her.
      Their raucous voices fitted the rough woodland, the vigorous autumn
      smells, the haze of the mellow golden morning. She came again to the
      little brown brook gurgling quietly over its bed of brown stones and
      leaves and the fancy took her to follow its course. Wet feet were of no
      consequence, determined to see all of her possessions Ruth skirted its
      purling side and discovered presently that here the brook, lifted from the
      earth by hand of artifice, was confined to a long, shallow, wooden
      aqueduct, an aqueduct open to the air and to the tracery of boughs above
      and to blue skies reflected in the water. Through this conduit the little
      brook bubbled and bounded, clear as crystal; icy cold to the touch as she
      dipped her hand in and let the water run along her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought the young lady, &ldquo;this must be our famous spring!&mdash;I've
      reached the headquarters of the Nile or I'm very near them.&rdquo; And through
      the trees in truth, she perceived, further on, a rough hut, built to
      protect the stream's source from inroads of man and beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat herself on a fallen tree trunk, leaned back and gazed with
      half-closed eyelids into the network of branches&mdash;oaks, larches,
      birch, hazel, maple,&mdash;nearly bare of foliage. Here again, the ground,
      checkered with green moss-patches was interspersed with little plants,
      &ldquo;which must be all a-flower in the spring,&rdquo; thought Ruth and she vowed
      that when spring came she would return to pluck them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;presto!... Without a note of warning&mdash;the agreeable
      independence of her mood vanished. Lucilla, Pontycroft!... Her mind, her
      heart, her very soul yearned for them. And a homesick longing for the
      finished, for the humanly beautiful, the artistically beautiful,&mdash;an
      intense craving and desire for a familiar European face&mdash;smote her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; she puzzled, &ldquo;would they, those I want most to see,
      <i>could they endure this wilderness?</i> No&mdash;not Lucilla! Not
      Lucilla with her love of luxury and her disdain of short skirts.&rdquo; She
      laughed. &ldquo;Pontycroft? Perhaps,&rdquo; her heart fluttered. She knew he doted
      upon old, formal gardens, well-clipped lawns; had delight in the glorious
      army of letters and of art,&mdash;that he found in the society too, of
      princes, entertainment. Still, it might be possible.... He would, at all
      events, have some whimsical thing to say about it all. She began to fancy
      that she heard his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were here,&rdquo; Ruth told herself, &ldquo;I should ask him to interpret the
      horrid vision I had last night.&rdquo; Ruth shivered as she recalled it; rapidly
      she began an imaginary conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lying in the big, carved, four-post family bedstead in my bedroom,&rdquo;
       Ruth informed him. &ldquo;I was half asleep and half awake and I saw myself
      coming up the steps into the house just as I did when I arrived. As I
      came, the house door opened, quickly, from within, and four people rushed
      towards me, with open arms. One was my father.&mdash;He clasped me
      tenderly and said: 'Welcome, welcome home!'... Behind him, a tall, large,
      old man clasped me in his arms and he cried: 'Welcome, welcome home!' Then
      came another and with the same words bade me welcome; I felt very happy,
      and so glad that I had come! But running down the stairs of the house
      arrived a tiny, meagre, old lady, whose corkscrew curls bobbed at either
      side her face. She cried: 'Welcome, welcome!' in a shrill, high voice,
      seizing me in her embrace. 'Welcome!' she cried again, 'but <i>look out!&mdash;We
      can bite!</i>' And as she said it her two sharp white teeth went through
      my lips till I screamed with pain and started up&mdash;all a-tremble&mdash;and
      then I fell back onto the bed and shook for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sweet child!&rdquo; the sane amused voice of Pontycroft made reply. &ldquo;These
      old four-post family bedsteads are dangerous affairs to sleep in. <i>Quant-à-moi</i>,
      I've always avoided 'em.... I'll have nothing whatever to do with them. If
      my great-aunt, from whom I inherited Pontycroft, had not been of my way o'
      thinking I should have sold those at Pontycroft to the old furniture
      dealer in the village. Fortunately, that fearless lady lifted the obloquy
      of the act from my shoulders by disposing of them herself. One day, while
      my uncle, her husband, scoured the high seas under Nelson, she got rid of
      all the old family four-posters. When he returned from the war and asked
      what had become of 'em she acknowledged she'd discovered a preference for
      bronze beds and had sent to France for a dozen. But he was far too
      thankful to be at home again. 'Peace now, at any price,' said he. And he
      never mentioned four-posters to his lady-wife again, but slept and snored
      contentedly, for forty odd years, in a red-gold, steel enamelled affair,
      free of family traditions. You'd better follow my aunt's example, Ruth.
      Send to Boston for a nice new white enamelled bedstead with a nice new
      wire mattress and let no more family ghosts worry your ingenuous small
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, what did it mean? After all, it happened, or I'm mad,&rdquo; Ruth
      laughing, heard herself insist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Pontycroft,&mdash;he gave her one of his droll glances&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you want your midnight vision interpreted you must ask some older sage,
      even, than I, to do it. I should say, were it not too obvious to be true,
      that apple pie with an under crust....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sort invented by your French ancestress, Priscilla Mulline Alden
      (I've heard she was a rare <i>cordon bleu</i>)&rdquo; went on Pontycroft,
      unperturbed, &ldquo;together with New England brown bread&mdash;but&mdash;that's
      all too obvious to be true... what are you laughing at?&rdquo; he queried,
      artlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm laughing at the Brown Bread,&rdquo; retorted Ruth, and she laughed aloud,
      &ldquo;there wasn't any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There should have been,&rdquo; said Ponty, with a deprecating lift of the
      eyebrows. &ldquo;It's <i>de rigueur</i> with baked beans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your little story,&rdquo; he continued, lighting his cigarette, &ldquo;belongs
      probably to those mysterious reflex actions of ancestry acting on a
      sensitive nervous organisation. You can't expect me to explain them. See,
      though, that you do look out. Don't, manifestly, offend your ancestors and
      they won't offend you, and there's my interpretation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Ruth laughed aloud, gleefully, at the tones of Ponty's voice and
      again a little thrill of pain and hope pierced her breast. She looked at
      her watch. It was almost noon and she turned towards home through the
      glade, by the path along the brook.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      But the adventure of her walk had not come to an end yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path widened into a grass-grown road. The day was so hot she regretted
      she hadn't brought her sunshade, but she walked with light buoyant steps,
      unreflecting,&mdash;amused by the antics of two blue, belated butterflies
      who, not perished with the summer, convinced it had come back a little,
      danced ahead of her chasing the shadows; they fluttered to the right and
      to the left, and came at last to rest upon a withered mullen stalk a few
      yards in advance of her. Ruth watched them while they sought greedily,
      making a rapid tour of the dried stem, for some lone flower upon which to
      replenish their hungry attenuated little stomachs. She almost held her
      breath, as she paused to watch the quest and she wished she might, by a
      wave of her stick, restore fresh succulence to the weeds, when&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, stop!&rdquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively, Ruth shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a snake ahead of you&mdash;there&mdash;just across the path.
      Don't move!&rdquo; cried the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate stood perfectly still. She saw a man run by her; she heard the
      sharp report of a gun. The smell of gunpowder filled her nostrils and the
      terror of the sudden cry made her feel sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried the owner of the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excited young man presented upon the muzzle of his gun a viscous two
      feet of snake, an object that limply resembled the straight, flat limb of
      a tree. &ldquo;A copperhead. 'Tis the only deadly dangerous beast in these
      harmless woods. As I'm alive, if you had put your foot on him you would,
      indeed, have found him deadly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He extended the flabby thing for Ruth's inspection, but the young lady
      looked away&mdash;her arm instinctively went out to clutch at something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cause for fright, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; said the young chap. He proffered a
      hand to steady her. &ldquo;I'm afraid I gave you a terrible scare,&rdquo; he added,
      apologetic, and he looked at her with concern, &ldquo;but that was better than
      the bite. You're quite white; sit down a moment. You'll soon feel better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she said, with an involuntary shudder, but she did not sit
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there many of those creatures in the woods?&rdquo; she asked, but she felt
      ashamed of her weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, especially not at this time of year. The warm sun brought this one
      out. You should never walk about here in low shoes, though, Miss Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my name,&rdquo; Ruth said, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it for granted you're General Adgate's niece, having a walk
      through your woods. The whole town knows you arrived last night,&rdquo; answered
      the young man, with a bow, smiling at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile was pleasant, he looked at her with friendly interest. In shabby
      tweeds and a pair of leggings, a game-bag slung over his shoulder, he was
      evidently out for a day's shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think I'm a trespasser, though I can't show you my permit. But your
      uncle and I are old friends,&rdquo; he vouchsafed. &ldquo;I'm privileged, I must tell
      you, to shoot here when I like. In fact, I rather fancy the quail you sat
      down to at supper last night was the product of my game-bag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Ruth that this remark came somehow with bad taste&mdash;the
      speaker's eyes shone, however, with so kindly a light she hadn't the heart
      to resent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a marvellous shot,&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I served under your uncle in the Cuban War,&rdquo; the young man told her. &ldquo;We
      had sharp fighting then, Miss Adgate. But we're well drilled, here in
      Oldbridge&mdash;not a man jack of us but can pick an ace on a playing card
      at fifty paces. That's all due to your uncle who supervises the
      rifle-practice at the Armoury, to say nothing of coaching us in military
      tactics, which he's past master in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ruth, interested. &ldquo;I supposed he was the most peaceable of
      retired military men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peaceable and retired if you like. But in times of peace, prepare for
      war.... The way we are made to answer up to call on drill nights would
      cause your blood to freeze, Miss Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma ché!</i> I thought I'd come to a quiet, sleepy New England town
      where all was love and peace! The day after I arrive I learn I am in a
      hotbed of militarism,&rdquo; laughed Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; the young man replied seriously, striding beside her.
      &ldquo;General Adgate, you see, has been through two wars. He received his
      brevet of General in the war between the North and the South. He realises
      the importance of preparing for emergencies, now that we've taken our
      place among the nations. He's a splendid chap. Not one of us but would
      walk or fight our way to death for him.... And it's always been so. Why,
      they tell this story when he was just a Captain, in the War of Secession.
      The enemy was pouring bomb and shell into his entrenchments. He ordered
      his soldiers on their bellies, and in the midst of the cannonading up he
      got, stood,&mdash;coolly lighting a cigarette: 'Now, my men,' said he,
      'rush for them!' The men rose in a body, leapt the entrenchments, fell
      upon the enemy. Of course the enemy was routed! we captured and brought
      back guns and ammunition with cheers to camp. Then it was, I believe, he
      was breveted General Adgate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth had a shiver of pride as she listened. &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; continued her
      informant, &ldquo;worse luck, in these cowardly moneyed times, there's no fun to
      be got out of war! You stand up, of course, to be slaughtered wholesale.
      Now&mdash;the best shot has little hope of bringing down his man&mdash;there's
      nothing to practise on but quail and partridge in the old General's
      woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And snakes,&rdquo; put in Ruth, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snakes,&rdquo; repeated the young fellow, with a merry laugh. &ldquo;Thrice blessed
      copperheads!&rdquo; went his mental reservation,&mdash;so quickly is youth
      inflamed in America. &ldquo;But a bounty's on every one of these wretches, Miss
      Adgate,&rdquo; he said aloud (and Ruth, fortunately, perhaps, was not a mind
      reader.) &ldquo;They've almost disappeared. Truth is, like the rest of us, this
      one came out to welcome you, poor devil, and he's met with a sad end!
      Since the new law a snake may not look at a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached, as they strolled, the foot of the Adgate hill. As they
      neared the gate the young man paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must bid you good-bye,&rdquo; said he, lifting his hat, &ldquo;it's long past noon,&mdash;almost
      your luncheon hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Ruth suggested, &ldquo;since you and my uncle are friends won't you come
      in to us for lunch? You shall go back to your shooting, your rescuing of
      damsels, when we've refreshed you. I dare say there's some of that quail
      left,&rdquo; she added, with an occult smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate,&rdquo;&mdash;the young man visibly struggled with temptation....
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate,&rdquo; he looked into the pretty flushed face and he felt himself
      smitten to the heart's core. &ldquo;That's very good of you; I'm afraid, though,
      you don't know our New England customs. You've a hospitable, beautiful
      English habit, but you've not been here long enough to know that we don't
      ask folk unexpected-like to lunch; not unless they're blood relatives or
      bosom friends. Tradition, ceremony, convention forbid it and a gorgon more
      awful still. Her name is&mdash;Maria-Jane!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!...&rdquo; Ruth laughed. &ldquo;But she's paid for that! It is part of her
      duty....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>dear</i> Miss Adgate, you won't find it easy. Love won't buy them,
      money won't purchase them, though I dare say,&mdash;you'll have a way with
      you will make them see black white. But if you risk asking me, I won't,
      and for your sake&mdash;accept&mdash;though I'm horribly tempted to.
      Besides, think of it, tradition, ceremony, convention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth felt herself getting angry. Here was a youth she didn't care twopence
      for, who had done her more than a civility, but who presumed to instruct
      her in a provincial code of manners. She would show him she was mistress
      of her household&mdash;then be done with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ceremony, what convention?&rdquo; she demanded coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; the young man replied undaunted, &ldquo;no one wants his neighbour to know
      he sits down to a joint, a couple of vegetables and apple pie for his
      midday meal. We make such a lot of fuss here when we ask people to eat
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's precisely the staple of every one's luncheon in England, from
      Commoner to Lord,&rdquo; cried Ruth. &ldquo;No one makes a secret of it&mdash;it's
      called the children's dinner. Whatever frills may be added, there or here,
      the joint, the vegetables and the pudding, which amounts to the pie, are
      invariably present and the most patronised. I assure you it's the luncheon
      every one ought to eat. And now,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;open the gate and shut
      it behind you, and be satisfied to partake of our vegetables, our joint
      and our pudding without further ado.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept,&rdquo; said the delighted young fellow. &ldquo;But if General Adgate turns
      me out-o'-doors, I shall bend to the New England custom I was brought up
      in and not hold you responsible for my discomfiture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ascended the hill, over the softest, greenest turf; they went under
      the apple trees despoiled of apples,&mdash;passed through the rustic gate,
      and entered the garden. To the youth, the garden was all fragrant of
      blossoms which must have burst into flower over night. Such delusive
      things have a trick of happening, in New England, to an old garden, to
      welcome the desired person, and Ruth, though she didn't suspect it, had
      already become the desired person in the eyes of her victim. The syringa
      tree under which they went spread for them a miraculous white canopy; the
      white pinks threw forth aromatic scents which penetrated by the door into
      the house as Ruth brought her companion to General Adgate, seated before a
      rousing wood fire reading his newspapers in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate preceded her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; she boldly proclaimed, &ldquo;I've brought a friend of yours to
      luncheon.&rdquo; General Adgate looked up from his book. &ldquo;Why&mdash;Rutherford!
      glad to see you,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands none too cordially. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he
      smiled as he pushed a chair forward for Ruth, &ldquo;my niece waylaid you, did
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ruth told him. &ldquo;I was waylaid by a serpent in our woods. Mr.
      Rutherford happened by at the right moment to rescue me.&rdquo; Then Ruth went
      to the ancient gilt mirror above the fireplace and withdrew the pins from
      her hat and rang for Paolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saved the lady's life,&rdquo; General Adgate chuckled. &ldquo;Well done,
      Rutherford, my son&mdash;a plausible opening to the story to please the
      matter-of-fact public. As though the public were matter-of-fact!&mdash;Nothing
      is really improbable enough for the public, provided life's in the
      telling. We're ready to swallow the most unconscionable lies! But though
      you've lost no time in making the opening ordinary, Rutherford, we shall
      see what may be done to reward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; objected Rutherford, with happy laughter,&mdash;&ldquo;you of all men
      should know it&mdash;the service of Beauty brings its own reward to those
      lucky enough to serve it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunch is served, Miss,&rdquo; announced Martha patly, putting her head in at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a plate, please, Martha, for this gentleman,&rdquo; said Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shade (was it a look of displeasure?) crept into Martha's face; the
      reply came meekly. &ldquo;Yes, Miss,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate threw a gay glance at Rutherford, he returned it with one he
      meant to make eloquent of his admiration. But Ruth was saying, in that
      ravishing voice of hers: &ldquo;Shall we go in?&rdquo; She swept by him into the
      low-ceilinged, white-panelled dining-room with an air of dignity in her
      slim, young figure which Rutherford thought suited it to perfection.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      Poor old Rutherford is fond of recalling that memorable luncheon to this
      day. Ruth's joyous soul frothed into fun which sounded at times so exactly
      like Pontycroft that he seemed to be at her elbow. For a reason not hard
      to seek, to sophisticated minds, General Adgate, too, seemed in high
      spirits. Rutherford&mdash;well&mdash;we know what infatuated young men are&mdash;excellent
      company because they laugh at a word, could applaud the dullest saw.
      Neither Ruth nor General Adgate spoke in saws; by a saw we mean the easy
      pert phrase, <i>la phrase toute faite</i> which passes so readily for wit
      in any land. General Adgate was an accomplished raconteur. He could tell a
      story with an economy of language, a grace worthy the subtlest
      story-writers; the point, unexpected when it came, brought the house down.
      Ruth listened&mdash;astonished, and led him on. Rutherford's haww-hawws,
      more appreciative than musical, provided the essential base to the trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      When lunch was over Ruth ordered coffee to be served in the drawing-room.
      &ldquo;You're a daring creature! I've never had the courage to ask Martha to do
      that,&rdquo; objected General Adgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you always have coffee after luncheon?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I must e'en drink it where it's brought to me, at table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear! You see the advantage of having a woman by who fears nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see the advantage of having a fair niece to minister to my poor human
      wants,&rdquo; gallantly responded the General. &ldquo;And to make life extremely worth
      while, hey Rutherford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate is an adorable hostess. If I don't envy you as her uncle,
      General, it is because I find her perfect as Lady of Barracks Hill,&rdquo; said
      Rutherford. He said it with a flush and with the fear upon him that he had
      said too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Martha just then had entered bearing the coffee; Ruth, indicating the
      Japanese tea-table, took no notice of his speech. The table, the shining
      silver Georgian service on its silver tray were placed before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this old service, Uncle?&rdquo; Ruth asked as she lifted the
      elongated, graceful coffee-pot by its ebony handle and began to pour the
      coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martha must have unearthed that from the cupboard upstairs,&rdquo; answered her
      uncle. &ldquo;The salver has been put away for years. It belonged to your
      great-grandmother. But how did they manage to give it such a polish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate's maid helped me, sir,&rdquo; Martha vouchsafed in her primmest
      voice. &ldquo;We tried that new powder. It took no time at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room with her chin up as who should say: &ldquo;We know the proper
      thing to do, when there's someone at hand who knows we ought to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Rutherford, confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth's a mistress as gives satisfaction,&rdquo; General Adgate laughed softly
      while Martha's footsteps receded towards the kitchen. &ldquo;I believe,
      Rutherford, we'll be having our afternoon tea here yet, in the British
      fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ma, da vero! come si fa?</i>&rdquo; cried Ruth, lapsing into Italian in her
      surprise, &ldquo;don't you <i>always</i> have afternoon tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have <i>tea</i>, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; Rutherford answered merrily, &ldquo;tea with
      cold meat, stewed fruit and cake at six o'clock. Not a minute later, mind
      you. Martha and Bridget have something better to do than to be serving
      even you all day. By seven of the clock one is off with one's young man or
      running over to mother's.... You need not inquire at what hour we get
      back, we have the latch-key, and your breakfast's generally served on
      time.&rdquo; Ruth cast a wild look at General Adgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his diminished head: &ldquo;I'm afraid it's true,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;a&mdash;universal habit,&mdash;in Oldbridge?&rdquo; asked Ruth, her
      eyes dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has to be the universal habit,&rdquo; answered Rutherford. &ldquo;We simply can't
      help ourselves. We could get no one at all to wait upon us if we didn't
      conform to it. The&mdash;the&mdash;and the&mdash;are the only people in
      town who are known to have late dinners and that's because, hopelessly
      Europeanised, they don't care what they pay their girls, and keep a
      butler. Even they are obliged to dine at seven;&mdash;besides,&rdquo; laughed
      Rutherford, &ldquo;late dinners <i>ain't 'ealthy!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Ruth, thoughtfully, &ldquo;the custom is primitive, not to say
      Puritan; I think it suits Oldbridge. Our forefathers had to do with less
      service I suppose. And as you say, late dinners <i>ain't 'ealthy</i>. But
      Paolina shall give us our afternoon tea, at four, Uncle. It will make her
      feel at home to serve it to us. But aren't you famished for some music? I
      want to try the Steinway. This morning when I came down I raised the lid
      and saw the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose from her corner of the sofa and seated herself at the piano. <i>Oft
      have I travelled in those Realms of Gold</i>... Presently she had started
      her two companions, travelling, journeying <i>in those Realms of Gold</i>
      which Chopin opens to the least of musicians. Chopin's austerity of
      perfect beauty wrought in a sad sincerity,&mdash;entered the New England
      drawing-room. To General Adgate's ears the music seemed to lend voice at
      last,&mdash;give expression, at last,&mdash;to holy, self-repressed,
      patient lives,&mdash;lives of the dead and the gone&mdash;particles of
      whose spirit still clung, perhaps, to the panelled walls, pervaded,
      perhaps, the air of the old room. To Ruth, this incomplete New England
      world, which something more than herself and less than herself was, for
      the nonce, infatuated with, possessed by,&mdash;which yet, to certain of
      her perceptions,&mdash;revealed itself as a milieu approaching to
      semi-barbarism, Oldbridge, melted away. At her own magic touch, Italian
      landscapes, rich in dreams, rich in love, abundant; decked forth in fair
      realities, intellectual joys,&mdash;complete and vibrant of absolute
      beauty, harmonious, suggestive,&mdash;rose, took shape before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls</i>, among pink fragrant oleanders,&rdquo;
       she repeated, smiling to her thoughts as she played and forgot the
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rutherford, Rutherford,&mdash;oh,&mdash;of course&mdash;Rutherford found
      in those heavenly chords and melodies what every lover finds in Chopin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth turned around upon her piano stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had enough?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough?&rdquo; exclaimed the lovesick youth. &ldquo;I, for one could never have
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Toujours perdrix!</i>&rdquo; said Ruth and lifted up a warning finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play us something else, child,&rdquo; said her uncle in a matter-of-fact tone
      intended to disperse sentimentality. &ldquo;Let us hear your Russians and a
      little Schubert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Ruth played the Valse Lente from the Fifth Tschaikowsky Symphony
      and the famous Rachmaninoff which, I believe, everybody plays, and
      finished at last with the Fourth Fugue of the immortal Bach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I'm tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; said the transcriber, laying down the pen.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      Young Rutherford bounded from his chair. The tall clock in the hall, as
      though loth to mark the passage of Time,&mdash;Time,&mdash;who had been
      its friend for something more than a hundred and fifty years,&mdash;the
      steadfast old clock began to mark three very slow, slow notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate, forgive me! I suppose I ought to go, you should be left to
      rest!&rdquo; he held out his hand. &ldquo;I've never known any pleasure comparable to
      this afternoon's. May I come again? The whole of Oldbridge shall envy me
      to-day,&mdash;I'm too vain not to tell them where I've lunched. Good-bye,
      goodbye,&rdquo; he repeated. He gave Ruth a furtive glance and flushed, very
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Rutherford,&rdquo; said General Adgate. He smiled indulgence to the
      young man who still malingered. &ldquo;We'll see you to-night,&rdquo; he reassured
      him, with a nod. &ldquo;Ruth, you're to make yourself splendid tonight. I'm to
      take you to dine at the Wetherbys. They are giving a dinner party in your
      honour, for knowing you were not ridden yet with engagements I accepted
      for you. There will be some sort of a reception afterwards&mdash;you'd
      call it <i>At Home</i> wouldn't you? Everyone's coming. Everybody wants to
      meet Miss Adgate.&rdquo; He laughed, as though well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he's proud of me,&rdquo; thought Miss Adgate, gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door at last closed on Rutherford. Niece and uncle stood together in
      the hall, where the voice of the family time-piece, its brass face marking
      the phases of the sun and moon, underlined the pervading stillness of the
      house with an austere, admonitative, solemn &ldquo;tick-tack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; said her uncle abruptly, &ldquo;why did you come to America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&mdash;To see you, of course,&rdquo; Ruth said, her tone one of innocent
      surprise, but she felt a little guilty catch at her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&mdash;me!&rdquo; her uncle said. &ldquo;You young witch, you never crossed the
      seas to look at an old man. It was as much my business to cross them to
      look after you. Come,&rdquo; said he, with a look of raillery, &ldquo;there was some
      precipitating cause. You came in a hurry. Something happened&mdash;for you
      might have put your journey off for another year. Something occurred, to
      induce you&mdash;to come&mdash;in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth hesitated. She gave a light laugh&mdash;then she looked away. &ldquo;Shall
      I really tell you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sooner you tell me,&rdquo; said the old General, &ldquo;the better,&mdash;for
      then we'll understand one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left Europe,&rdquo;&mdash;Ruth said, embarrassed, &ldquo;because&mdash;because&mdash;I
      wanted to see&mdash;my uncle&mdash;and have a look at my ancestral acres!&rdquo;
       she still prevaricated, yet dimpling with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ancestral acres!&rdquo;&mdash;repeated her uncle, sceptically. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he
      encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;because,&mdash;if you must have another reason still,
      well&mdash;because&mdash;well&mdash;I felt sore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said General Adgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Ruth with a persistent and feminine reluctance to reveal her
      real self, speak her true reasons: &ldquo;Uncle,&mdash;I wish&mdash;you wouldn't
      ask me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with it,&rdquo; said her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertram, Crown Prince of Altronde, wanted me to marry him morganatically.
      I felt outraged, though they told me it would be a legal marriage. Harry
      Pontycroft and Lucilla sympathised with my disgust and packed me off. And&mdash;that
      is why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked grave. &ldquo;Damned European whelps,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;No
      wonder your Puritan ancestors shook that dust from their souls. You did
      well,&rdquo; he said, patting Ruth on the back.
    </p>
    <h3>
      X
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ruth went upstairs without another word. The upper hall was lined with
      bookshelves reaching to the ceiling. &ldquo;I must add a library to this dear
      place,&rdquo; she said to herself while she sought for a book. She was tired,&mdash;she
      wanted to lie down, she wanted to wash from her mind the impressions of
      the day; she felt completely fagged.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Adgate came upstairs behind her while she was peering along the
      shelves of calf-bound books. The shelves seemed to hold only a monotonous
      row on row of histories and works of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; he said as he passed her, and, pausing, he removed a book
      from an upper shelf and handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a volume of Governor Bradford's History of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ruth weakly objected, &ldquo;I wanted a novel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find that more interesting than any novel,&rdquo; General Adgate threw
      over his shoulder as he proceeded on to his own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      O Reflex Egotism! Ruth found the book more interesting than any novel.

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Old Town of
      Oldbridge is rich of one pleasant winding highway along whose route are
      scattered its prettiest demesnes. Time was, once, when this sun-spattered,
      tree-bordered thoroughfare enjoyed its dream of peace in drowsy quietude,
      under spreading lindens and over-arching elms. To-day, however, it stirs
      in its dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet its ancient houses stand placidly enough. Comfortable and serene among
      park-like meadows, life in them goes on with a simple dignity and ease;
      and if they are the sometime innocent cause of the sin of pride to the
      families who inherit them, they are sources of arcadian joys to the
      stranger within their gates. For they are all spotless and restful&mdash;and
      fragrant of the breaths of several hundred years of new-mown hay,
      rose-arbours, and aromatic pinks, blown through the windows. These old
      Colonial homes speak eloquently of good life past, of still better life
      present&mdash;to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trolley-track and the pretty road keep company a bit, together; they
      both turn to the left and passing in all say twenty houses, reach the
      Common and the Post Office, where a dozen or so more hipped roofs, set
      among quiet flower gardens and apple orchards lend tradition and a quaint
      distinction to the really lovely old Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys of Oldbridge have pre-empted this Green, the most popular of
      Sports Clubs, and here, after school, as their forbears did, as their
      fathers and grandfathers did, here they play and tumble and wrestle and
      fight. From here they cross the road to enter the Public School House, a
      red brick building which, thirty years ago, supplanted the Dames School,
      and which balances the old brick Meeting House at the further end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The haunt, trysting-place, council chamber&mdash;where every mischievous
      plot is hatched, such is the Common. Whence the eternal Boy, lured by
      near-flowing waters of the Mantic joins his pals upstream for a swim,
      plays uproarious pranks there, ties a chap's clothes into a hard knot on
      the bank and when he comes dripping out in search of them chants, in
      raucous chorus: &ldquo;<i>Chaw raw beef&mdash;the beef is tough!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Winter, the frozen River Mantic makes an unrivalled skating ground; and
      the Oldbridge Boy still builds his ice-fortress on the Common, stocks it
      (ammunition of snow-balls)&mdash;and leads his regiment to victory. Here
      he coasts or hitches his sledge to a huge one fleetly passing, gets a
      glorious ride&mdash;comes home, nose and fingers frost-bitten, exceeding
      argumentative; talking in loud imperious voice; in truth a very dog of
      wintry joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too often, after supper, the Boy of Oldbridge takes delectable but stolen
      interest in the conversation of the village Post Master and his cronies.
      By the door in Summer&mdash;round the stove in Winter, he and they discuss
      the politics of the hour to many hoary anecdotes between. Pastime sternly
      prohibited by parents requiring infinite discretion! Thus one steals with
      muffled tread down by back stairs, one issues forth by back windows, one
      whistles to one's <i>fides achates</i>&mdash;and off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate, who to her regret had never been a small boy, never would be,
      was none the less of opinion that boys are the most amusing imps and she
      soon exercised her opportunity for making the acquaintance of a New
      England lad, Master Jack Enderfield, the twelve-year-old son of Mrs.
      Enderfield, who lived in the Enderfield House on the Common. Mr.
      Enderfield, after preaching to his world for fifteen years, had left it,
      with, he feared on his death-bed, little advantage to its soul. He had
      gone leaving a library full of theological tracts and treatises, of
      philosophic books and pamphlets, a comfortable fortune inherited from
      collateral great-aunts,&mdash;and a son, Jack. Jack was blond, blue-eyed,
      curly haired, of an enquiring expansive nature towards those in whom he
      felt confidence, and a diverting person. Having met Miss Adgate at his
      mother's, when she returned the lady's call he considered himself entitled
      to drop in when he liked at Barracks Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got such stunning hair, mother, and such white hands.... And when
      she talks it makes a fellow feel good. She uses such pretty words and her
      voice is low and round. And she listens to a man and draws him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, it may not be convenient for Miss Adgate to receive you so
      often,&rdquo; said Mrs. Enderfield. &ldquo;Miss Adgate has other people to see, other
      things to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she has always time to see me,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a wave of the
      hand. &ldquo;She told Martha to say she was out the other day when the Wetherbys
      called. She took me up to her sitting room and showed me a lot of jolly
      European things and gave me this paper knife.&rdquo; Jack drew from an inside
      pocket, offering it for inspection, a Venetian filagree paper knife
      wrapped in soiled and crumpled tissue paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maternal heart could not withstand such obvious proof of favouritism
      towards her idol. Though warned not to wear his welcome out, Jackie
      descended frequently upon Barracks Hill, but this, though it concerns,
      runs ahead, of the story.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate received calls for a month; paid them&mdash;was dined&mdash;was
      less wined than vastly cocktailed,&mdash;in simple or elaborate New
      England fashion. She returned these hospitalities and she discovered that
      Oldbridge New and Oldbridge Old held agreeable people. If they treated her
      a little as an Egeria she accepted the rôle without fuss and gave to
      modesty its due.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these new acquaintances, of a pretty taste in letters, on far more
      than nodding terms with art, had, after years spent abroad&mdash;fallen
      like herself alack, upon a day! Alack the day on which we come to the
      disputably sage conclusion that East,&mdash;West.... We know, we learn&mdash;too
      late, sometimes alas, the fatal rest! And they had cast behind them the
      dust of the East, and they had turned Westward with a very lively sense of
      the superior enchantments of Europe. But once at home a devout
      appreciation of the sweet repose ('tis the just phrase), an imperceptible
      abandonment to that soothing peace which hovers insidious over a New
      England homestead, ah, ye rewards of Virtue! these had quietly engulfed in
      sodden well-being, the finer European impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate a little later, perceived that these wise people&mdash;settled
      ere long unblushingly to New Englandism, never again intended to budge.
      They had accepted, deliberately, the prose of life. And Miss Adgate,
      enamoured of New England, still kept her head enough to wonder, with some
      dismay, whether she, too, if she stayed here, she, too, would end by
      looking upon Oldbridge New and Oldbridge Old as the be-all and end-all of
      existence! So many things spoke here to her heart. Her tender spirit
      basked here, all day, in good will. But wasn't Oldbridge just a trifle
      lacking in effervescence? And yes&mdash;didn't Oldbridge take itself a bit
      solemnly? Ah, yes! And&mdash;yes&mdash;it had a distressing tendency to be
      very serious about everything. To none of these states of mind had Ruth
      been initiated, and every good Catholic knows that mirth is from God,
      dullness from the Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate, who had hitherto lived on the plane of an impersonal, if
      somewhat facetious consideration of public matters,&mdash;of wit,
      persiflage; Miss Adgate found when it came to small gossip that she was an
      irritated listener. Carping criticism made her yawn, she became dumb, had
      nothing to say. It is indeed a stupid trade! Moreover her soul had ever
      disported in innocent folly, in gaiety and witty conversation. She soon
      attracted those who cared for the same light stuff and Barracks Hill
      became, ere long, the centre of a coterie of frolic, music, and laughter,
      where personalities except in the ways of honest chaff were tabooed&mdash;and
      no one's affairs, wonder of wonders! were commented upon behind his back.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      But, after all, Barracks Hill it was, &ldquo;poetic, historic Barracks Hill,&rdquo;
       which spoke to her fancy,&mdash;held her heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      This house and the hill of this house were suggestive; packed full of
      romance. Ruth, whose temper was a charming compound of mirth love and
      poesy,&mdash;Ruth who had the soul of a poet in the body of a fair woman,&mdash;Ruth
      now fell deep in love with reverie.&mdash;She spent long days in a
      singular sort of trance. Lingering in a room she pondered its messages&mdash;wandering
      upon the hill, she dreamed and mused. The room mysteriously unburdened
      itself of long pent emotions,&mdash;joys and woes; the hill unfolded its
      soul, opened wide its heart to her; and lonely desolate ghosts&mdash;the
      ghosts of monotonous, innocent, happy, sorry lives confided in her&mdash;told
      her their tales of pain; disclosed to her their rapture of hope, their
      mysteries of birth and love and aspiration&mdash;their tragedy of denial&mdash;and
      of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth hearkened to invisible messengers. As she came and went in the still
      house, they floated towards her light as down,&mdash;intangible, so
      perceptible,&mdash;in the quiet house, and through the corridors. But
      Love's very breath greeted her on the hill.... Love met her there, with
      exuberance by day; Love wept there, in her heart&mdash;bitter tears&mdash;by
      night. Yes, a secret sadness brooded at the core of those ghostly souls.
      But a musical refrain, a simple entreaty seemed ever in the air and its
      contrapuntal burden: &ldquo;<i>Love, love and laughter! Give us love and
      laughter!</i>&rdquo; they implored&mdash;conquered her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hope in me!&rdquo; Ruth thought, wondering and wide-eyed.... &ldquo;They have
      confidence in me! The old place believes in me; it trusts me, it knows
      that I love it; it knows I reverence <i>them</i>.... It knows, <i>they</i>
      know, how my spirit would wish to cull those unfulfilled desires, every
      one they long to lighten themselves of, and bring each one to its fruition
      if I can. Yes, each of you dear ghosts, you who have been lonely so long
      and friendless&mdash;you know I'll execute your bidding if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, every day, at the little Catholic Parish Church, Ruth said a Rosary
      for the house and for the souls that had passed through it. And she
      visited the house, from attic to cellar. She was convinced that on one
      occasion she saw a veritable ghost who, smiling at her, passed across the
      attic. She discovered there, at all events, some fine old pieces of
      furniture, white with dust; and she caused these to be cleansed and
      polished and placed in the rooms.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      One fine December morning Ruth walked with Miranda on the hill. She was
      beginning to have projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miranda!&rdquo; said she,&mdash;&ldquo;Heaven knows where you picked the name up,&rdquo;
       mused Ruth. &ldquo;Dear kitten, I believe I'll invite my European friends here!
      The fashion is in Europe to come and have a look at America. I'll keep
      open house, and you and I and General Adgate shall receive the most famous
      people in Europe at Barracks Hill. And we'll show them what they ought to
      be curious about, what they've seen only in books,&mdash;we'll show them a
      beautiful old New England town enriched from all sources yet keeping its
      distinct New England flavour. And I'll give to Oldbridge the enlivening
      experience,&rdquo; she said with a gleam, &ldquo;of hobbing and of nobbing with every
      light-minded modern who doesn't take life's trivialities solemnly; with
      every human of talent who cultivates the sweet tonic spirit of levity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miranda listened, his chrysoprase eyes widened&mdash;contracted&mdash;blazed
      with intelligent sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with you, if it's anything that has to do with fun,&rdquo; he loudly
      purred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miranda was not a kitten&mdash;Miranda was a sleek, a superb
      tortoise-shell cat. A cat of the masculine persuasion who could have
      counted six or seven summers if a day. General Adgate had, in &ldquo;a tonic
      spirit of levity,&rdquo; christened him at his birth Miranda&mdash;it may be
      because the Master of Barracks Hill had likened himself that day to
      Prospero. Be this as may be, Miranda had kept his youth; his idea of beer
      and skittles was still to play at any game he could find a playmate for;
      he, at least, was all for sociability.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was his friendly habit to follow Ruth, running along the wall of
      the terrace at her left as she paced the hill. Now, when she addressed
      him, he drew himself lazily, along the warm stones, stretched himself
      infinitely, clawed the rough stones deluged in December sunshine, and
      assuming an irresistible attitude as she spoke, pricked his ears. Then,
      with a bound made across the turf to an apple-tree, mad for a frolic. He
      ran up its grey side, lichen-covered, paused, looked down, and jeered at
      her over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you follow me?&rdquo; he taunted. Took, the next moment, his leap
      over her head, landed at her feet, was scuttling deliriously through wheel
      ruts, grass-grown, passage of last year's cartwheels. Burrowing under
      accumulations of brown crackling leaves, flattening himself lengthwise,
      poking out a pink nose at her, he showed a pair of questioning,
      mischievous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send out your invitations,&rdquo; counselled he, &ldquo;but first, catch me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth plunged to a great rustle of dry leaves, and light and irresponsible
      as they Miranda darted to a sheltering juniper. Ruth tried to seize him&mdash;useless
      vanity, for he was quicksilver. Up another tree ere she could lay hands on
      him, he, perhaps not disdainful of a little petting, and at all events Bon
      Prince, finally relented; he allowed her at last to have her way, come
      close and take him in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a duck,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing, scratching his ears, laying her
      cheek against his fur all glossy and fragrant of wood odours. &ldquo;Such a
      mercurial duck! You make me feel thrice welcome here. I believe you are
      the spirit of the place. Yes&mdash;the little friendly spirit of the house
      who attracts and keeps those who love it for its good&mdash;who uses every
      wile, too, and coquetry to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miranda at her words slipped struggling through Ruth's arms to earth,
      arched his back, rubbed himself against her skirts, purred loud and long&mdash;circling
      round her, tail in air and as who should say: &ldquo;Yes, yes, no doubt. But let
      us waste no time in sentiment,&rdquo; and away he bounded to a remoter corner of
      the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! he's showing me the place,&rdquo; she cried. In genuine enjoyment of
      the sport she ran, eyes brimming with laughter, after the clever fellow as
      he trotted on; he beguiled her here and he beguiled her there; he
      discovered nooks to her full of interest and variety. And as she abandoned
      herself to the game, played and romped with him, it occurred to her once
      again that this, all this&mdash;was not all this verily part of a sort of
      terrestrial Paradise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here,&mdash;the chimneys of the house just visible below, here, aloof in a
      beautiful world,&mdash;she stood on the brow of her hill among gnarled
      fine old apple trees. She went up to one, she laid her cheek against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can understand what a sight you were in the Garden of Eden,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;In Spring, when your rosy blossoms are out,&mdash;in Autumn
      when you are hung with ripe red and golden fruit! And, yes&mdash;Henry
      Pontycroft's prophecy is fulfilled.... Here is Eve, sulking in her native
      apple orchard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Derrièr' chez mon père,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Vole, vole mon cour, vole&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Derrièr' chez mon père
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Y a un pommier doux&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Tout doux et you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Adam, or if Pontycroft were here...&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I should be vastly
      tempted&mdash;-tout doux et you-,&mdash;to tempt either of them. Oh, see
      how the rosy horizon is caught in its net woven of grey leafless branches!
      The sky is a sumptuous Prussian blue and how it fades at the zenith to
      palest azure! All the Royal colour is broken up by bold white clouds, and&mdash;this&mdash;ah,
      this is far too fair a sight for one pair of eyes to revel in alone. This
      cries, aloud, for Adam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth looked about her. At her feet, oddly enough, curiously enough, a red
      firm apple, forgotten there,&mdash;untouched by frosts,&mdash;at her feet
      lay a fine red pippin. She picked it up, she smiled, she wondered....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;there's only you&mdash;old Puss! Here, catch it,&rdquo; she
      cried to Miranda, who came running towards her, scenting the game he
      loved. With a gentle toss Ruth threw the apple along the turf and left
      Miranda to the ecstatic enjoyment of patting it, pushing it and rolling
      over it for quite eleven minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate had Miranda's approbation for inoculating Oldbridge with
      levity. She consulted General Adgate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you like, Ruth. Anything you like to keep you here contented.&rdquo;
       And he was not in the least fired by her schemes and had nothing further
      to say. But Miss Adgate sat down at this and scribbled fifty notes,
      selecting her first guests from all the worlds held in the one London
      World&mdash;the men, the women she liked, whose work she liked; the people
      who could be irrelevant at a pinch, amused, amusing. She invited them to
      visit her at Barracks Hill during the coming Summer, and in time she
      received effusive acceptances to her invitations.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Oldbridge Industrial Exhibits opens to-morrow night,&rdquo; General Adgate,
      tentatively, said one day. &ldquo;Do you care to go? You'll find all your
      friends. The Light Infantry Band will play to us. It's rather jolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If New England days in old New England houses are fruitful (to young women
      of &ldquo;high faculties quiescent&rdquo;), if they are fecund in long, poetic dreams,&mdash;if
      life in Oldbridge does offer limitless advantage for the building of
      castles in the air&mdash;none can deny that it has, too, its own artless
      way of playing up to the leading lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be left out for all the planets,&rdquo; protested Ruth. &ldquo;I'm curious
      to know what the Oldbridge Industries are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; answered her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off smiling, she could not conceive why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate was a sight for the gods,&rdquo; vowed Rutherford. &ldquo;Brown velvet,
      sables, to suit her brown hair with a red glint in it, and eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate doubtless was a sight for the gods, when (conducted by her
      uncle) she went the following evening to the Oldbridge Industrial
      Exhibits. As she was led first by young Rutherford, then by young Milman,
      then by young Massington, then by young Leffingwell, and then by young
      Wetherby&mdash;through a crowd of friends, to every stall and counter of
      the big illuminated hall,&mdash;as each of these young men explained,
      volubly, minutely, each exhibit&mdash;little was left, we may believe, of
      Oldbridge Industry which Ruth had not at the end fathomed, become well
      acquainted with. Pausing at one stall and at another, she ordered with
      reckless discrimination, rugs, lawnmowers, carpenter's tools, muslins,
      silks, furniture; and a surfeit of glass blown by a little glass-blower
      who had quite a local reputation for his designs; linens, too, and rugs of
      delicate colour dyed and woven in the neighbourhood upon a hand-loom a
      hundred years of age. The tools might do for Jobias. He had confided to
      Paolina that his stock was getting rusty; the mowers, asked the piratical
      salesman, are not lawnmowers forever getting out of order?
    </p>
    <p>
      These, Ruth's purchases, she destined for the new wing. She was furnishing
      the old Morris House, too. The Morris House General Adgate had, to her
      joy, just presented her with. This had been the home of a maternal
      greatgrandmother. From its portals, that lady with the patient eyes (whose
      portrait, painted by one Jarvis, hung in the drawing-room) having taken
      Admiral Richard Adgate for better or for worse under the Puritan marriage
      service read by Parson Ebenezer Allsworthy,&mdash;that lady had tripped
      across the hill to come and reign at Barracks Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Morris House! Miss Adgate destined it for her Summer overflow of
      guests. It is is a quaint and picturesque spot, all nooks and cupboards,
      within; of panelled walls and broad brick fireplaces. As its gardens
      overlook the purling brook and the Wigwam, it was, thought she, well
      suited to the purpose she intended&mdash;and it is in fact deserving of
      far more attention that this passing word can say for it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VII
    </h3>
    <p>
      On New Year's Day, Miss Adgate woke to a blizzard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Year in Oldbridge is feasted in that old-time pleasant fashion
      which has long ago <i>passé de mode</i> in New York, which is regarded
      with disfavour at Boston and in other New England towns. But Oldbridge
      perseveres in welcoming the New Year, for this smacks of ancientry, and,
      in sooth, the custom is a genial one. 'Tis well known that in Paris, every
      hostess, mistress of a salon, is deluged with cards and flowers and
      bonbons from Boissier on the New Year. At Rome, too, on the New Year, and
      in Vienna and Berlin, is it not considered courteous for a young man, not
      alone to leave his card, but to call wherever he has received a welcome?
      The servants of the houses he frequents, a hint to the wise, never allow
      him to forget his obligations; they pass at his lodgings betimes on the
      New Year and receive for their <i>Buon' Anno</i> a substantial Buono Mano.
      Oldbridge is, therefore, wholly in touch with the most modern capitals
      when it hospitably celebrates the New Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ruth, accompanied by Paolina, passed, by meadows all sparkling and
      white with hoar-frost, from the New Year's Midnight Mass at the Parish
      Church, the stars in a clear sky scintillated with suspicious brilliancy.
      The usual eager nipping air of a New England Autumn had until then
      condensed into just an occasional flurry of snow&mdash;or it had subdued
      its edge; the days were often warm enough to sit beside open windows. The
      American Winter had not begun to show its teeth. But from her bed to-day
      Ruth saw the flakes descend&mdash;small, dry,&mdash;to the rumour of low
      complaints, murmurs in the chimney. The flakes had a stealthy, a
      persistent look. Ruth, though, was very, sure the storm would prove the
      hitherto pretty diversion of a whitened landscape and trees, of a rapid
      thaw under warm sun, and Miss Adgate adored these snow falls! She had
      never, she thought, seen anything comparable to the white still beauty of
      the country and the wood, the gentian blueness of the sky when the snow
      had ceased, the clouds had emptied sack and the sun burst forth. When this
      happened she would put on a pair of high rubber boots, take a stick and
      start for a walk. And when, in her walk, she came across the marks of
      little feet along the snow,&mdash;squirrel tracks, mole tracks, the tracks
      of birds, quail, the larger ones of woodchucks, of foxes,&mdash;little
      existences living to themselves&mdash;which she could never know, never
      fathom&mdash;her mind would travel off into endless reveries and
      speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her rôle to-day was that of hostess and there would be no going out
      to-day after the snowfall. Miss Adgate shortly after breakfast sauntered
      into the kitchen to see how matters there were progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her, on the kitchen table, an array of angel cake, nut cake, pound
      cake, orange cake, maple-sugar cake lacked the supreme touch, and waited
      to be frosted. Spread upon a crackled Coalport dish a quantity of thin,
      brown, crisp, sugar wafers invited appetite. These wafers were from a
      recipe handed down in the Adgate family. Ruth knew the original, had seen
      it in Priscilla Mulline Alden's neat cramped little Huguenot handwriting;
      it was carefully preserved among the most curious of the Adgate relics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha, Ellen,&mdash;busy preparing endless edible New England subtleties
      in the buttery,&mdash;Margaret stirring an icing for the cake, General
      Adgate expected,&mdash;he had promised to come in an hour to brew his
      famous punch, the ingredients for which were mellowing and combining in
      the dining-room. Everything was, then, well under way, each aide-de-camp
      was at his post; the commander-in-chief felt she might safely mount to her
      dressing-room to let Paolina put on the robes of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it must be known that Paolina had taken to her new life with
      unexpected cheerfulness; and the reason was shortly to be disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorina,&rdquo; Paolina began timidly, while she dressed her mistress's hair
      in a high French twist, placed a bow of pale blue ribbon fetchingly to the
      left of the coil, poised it there like a butterfly with wings outspread,&mdash;&ldquo;Signorina&mdash;would&mdash;you
      be very angry if I confided to you, something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon what the something is, Paolina,&rdquo; said Ruth absently,
      giving her attention to the becoming effect of the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Signorina!&rdquo; sighed Paolina. Suddenly she clasped her hands; she held
      them out before her, dropped to her knees. &ldquo;Oh! Signorina! Jobias has
      asked me to marry him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jobias&mdash;has&mdash;asked you&mdash;to&mdash;marry him?&rdquo; repeated Ruth
      in astonishment. Then she began to laugh&mdash;laughed in merry peals of
      musical laughter, her head thrown back, her face a ripple of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Paolina was quite offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorina,&rdquo; she said, and she rose with dignity, &ldquo;why should it make you
      laugh to learn that Tobias has asked me to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Paolina,&rdquo; Ruth said; &ldquo;it is not that Jobias has asked you to
      marry him that makes me laugh&mdash;it is the tone in which you break the
      news to me.&rdquo; Then, gravely: &ldquo;And what did you say to him, Paolina, when he
      asked you to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signorina, I said I would have to ask you. I said that you were a mother
      to me, and that I would have to get your consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&mdash;&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;you really think of accepting him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I esteem him,&rdquo; said Paolina, &ldquo;I think he is a good man. He has saved up
      two thousand dollars. He has a nice house across the river which he lets
      out, and of which he reserves for himself one room. I think my own mother
      would be pleased with the match, if you approve, Signorina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you realise,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;that if you marry Jobias you cannot see
      your mother again? It costs a deal of money to cross the ocean. Jobias
      could not take you&mdash;he would have his work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Signorina, but <i>you</i> would take us! I would not leave you,
      Jobias said I need not. But when you marry (Jobias says you will surely
      marry, before long)&rdquo;&mdash;Paolina nodded her head several times
      sagaciously&mdash;&ldquo;then your husband will want a valet, and Jobias says he
      will be glad to put himself at your excellencies' services. And then, you
      will go abroad for the wedding tour, and you will want to take us. I can
      then go to my mother and receive her blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth caught her breath. &ldquo;Thus are our lives arranged for us,&rdquo; she thought,
      smiling, &ldquo;and by whom?&rdquo; For half an instant she was silent. Somewhere,
      among the recesses of memory, Ruth tried to recall such a conversation.
      She remembered&mdash;she had read it,&mdash;why,&mdash;it was in one of
      Corvo's witty tales.... So does history repeat itself. What the romancer
      invents women and men enact.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then, crisis of Paolina's life, the knocker at the front door
      went rat-tat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, and I'm not dressed yet. Put my dress on quickly, Paolina,&mdash;we'll
      finish our talk at some other time,&rdquo; Ruth exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paolina ran to the bed, lifted the pale blue chiffon gown inlaid with
      yellow lace&mdash;passed it dexterously, delicately, over Ruth's head, and
      began with her adroit, rapid fingers to lace the bodice. Martha knocked at
      the door: &ldquo;Master Jack Enderfield is in the drawing-room, Miss,&rdquo; she said
      in her precise voice. Ruth glanced at the clock&mdash;the hands pointed to
      ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Master Jack Enderfield I'll be down directly,&rdquo; she said. Ruth,
      standing before the cheval glass, gave a light pat here to her gown, a
      touch there to her coiffure&mdash;Martha lingered a minute to take the
      vision in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss,&rdquo; she said, closed the door, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ruth descended the stairs in a froufrou of skirts, wafting an odour
      of violets as she went along; and she greeted Master Jack Enderfield at
      the drawing-room door with that radiant grace the young man seemed so well
      able to appreciate.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VIII
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd come early,&rdquo; Jack explained, as he stood before the
      wood-fire in a man-of-the-world attitude: &ldquo;I knew that when the crowd
      began there'd be no chance for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm delighted you came early,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack sat down. He plunged at once into the subject which was on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all nonsense, this talk about a Republic,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;We'd have been
      much better off if we'd stuck to England. Oh, we mightn't have been so
      rich,&rdquo; he made a large gesture, &ldquo;but we'd have been nicer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, these sentiments on the New Year for a child of Liberty, a son of
      the Revolution!&rdquo; Ruth reproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not my fault, Miss Adgate, if I'm a son of the Revolution, and I
      don't believe in Liberty. I wish my double great-grandfather hadn't come
      over here and married my double great-grandmother.&rdquo; Master Jack stuck his
      hands doggedly in his pockets and glowered at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cheer up,&rdquo; laughed his young hostess. &ldquo;Accept the inevitable, Jack,
      make the best of it! But what can have happened to-day to make you think
      ill of Liberty and the Revolution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very well for you to sit there, Miss Adgate, sit and poke fun at me
      in your soft voice and your beautiful gown,&rdquo; Jack said, flushing. &ldquo;But you
      know as I do, that this&mdash;this country&mdash;is rotten&mdash;it's
      going to the dogs, nothing'll save it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jack,&rdquo; accused Ruth, &ldquo;you've been reading the newspapers!&rdquo; Miss
      Adgate never would, for her part, so much as look at an American
      newspaper; she got all her news by way of England, in the <i>Morning Post</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The demoralisation's in the air, Miss Adgate, the newspapers only tell
      what's happening. But our nation has the impertinence to go on, like a
      rooster on a wall, flapping its wings in the world's face and screeching,
      'Admire me! Don't I behave pretty?' No,&rdquo; continued Jack impressively, with
      a look of uncanny wisdom in his blue eyes, &ldquo;No&mdash;I'm going to skip
      this country as soon as I can get out of it. Here in quiet old Oldbridge,
      we're not so bad, though we do like to play a game among ourselves; proud
      of being old and aristocratic and so forth, and we expect if we're good
      we'll get to Heaven; some of us, though, don't remember Charity's the only
      way to get to Heaven! But the whole country's talking Choctaw,&mdash;with
      a hare lip&mdash;and only a few of us, like your uncle and old Mrs.
      Leffingwell and Mr. Massington, know what a good Anglo-Saxon Ancestry
      implies. The rest of us cackle like the aforesaid barnyard fowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate,&rdquo; went on Jack, briskly, &ldquo;no wonder! See how we mix affably
      with the riff-raff who haven't a language. People who are told by the
      blooming Constitution of this land that they're as good as you and me and
      make uncouth noises according. This I'm-as-good-as-you idea is all rot.
      They're not as good as you and they're not as good as me. I am better than
      the Butcher's boy, who hasn't brains enough to know his own foolish
      business and forgets to bring my meat. I am better than Ezekiel, who won't
      black my boots. Damn him,&rdquo; said the boy wildly, &ldquo;why shouldn't he black my
      boots? Let him do his honest work, like a man; become a useful member of
      society if he wants to get to be my equal! Not spend his days shirking and
      complaining through his nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, <i>dear</i> Jackie!&mdash;Have a glass of lemonade, have a cake!
      America's not so bad if you can rise above it,&rdquo; soothed Miss Adgate with,
      perhaps, a grain of malice. She rang for refreshments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the sweetest, prettiest, dearest thing in Oldbridge,&rdquo; the boy
      thought as he followed Ruth's movements with adoring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate, am I accountable for what my double great-grandfather did?&rdquo;
       Jack asked suddenly. &ldquo;I think he played me a low trick. He was one of
      these Cavalier people who stuck to Charles the Second. The King, after
      he'd come to the throne, offered him the Chancellorship of the Duchy of
      Lancaster. But the idiot refused it! He'd tasted blood, he said. He knew
      Court life, found it dull!&mdash;He wanted one of adventure, something
      like the dance he'd been leading with Charles. 'Give me land, Sire, in
      Virginia,' he said. 'I'll go out there and extend your Majesty's
      importance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate, <i>he should have stuck to Merry England</i>. And pray, what
      did his great-grandson do? Married a Northerner, became wife-ridden,
      dropped his title, sold his lands, went to New England, settled right here
      in Oldbridge, his wife's town; and equipped a regiment and fought. I'm
      glad to say he got killed, at Lexington. But not without leaving
      posterity, of which you see before you the last indignant remnant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, you find you're reverted to the state of mind of the Cavalier
      before he forsook England,&rdquo; Ruth said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Jack, you've a
      homesick hankering to go back there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;And, I'll tell you a still greater
      secret&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>C'est une journée de confidences</i>,&rdquo; thought Ruth, &ldquo;well?&rdquo; she
      encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate, we're not aristocratic,&rdquo; Jack declared in a low voice.
      &ldquo;We've just become low-down Provincials. But when I'm a man I mean to go
      and claim our lands and titles and our position in Devon. I'm the rightful
      heir! My father kept the Enderfield Tree in an old desk in the
      drawing-room. It's there, at this moment, in a tin tube, on parchment.
      I've often brought it out when my mother's at church and had a good look
      at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try a chocolate,&rdquo; interposed Ruth soothingly; but the image of the
      Enderfield tree in a tube made her laugh as she offered the lacquered box,
      inlaid with mother of pearl, which she kept filled for these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a Catholic, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; presently observed the youthful
      aristocrat when he had permitted Ruth's sweets to be thrust upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ruth urbanely. And&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder whether Jack is preparing
      to rend the Faith,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jack announced with deliberation,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to be a Catholic when I'm done with all this.&rdquo; He swept the
      present away with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; said Ruth, surprised. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's the only Faith for a Gentleman,&rdquo; the boy answered. &ldquo;For a
      gentleman and a scholar,&rdquo; he emendated. &ldquo;You see we're all compounded too
      much of human nature and we're all too much given to thinking. Yet our
      thinking leads nowhere,&mdash;in the end the flesh and the devil do what
      they like with us. We may sit with our heads between our hands, we may try
      to reconcile our human nature with idealism until we're ready for the
      madhouse, and we'll get to the madhouse, but we won't have solved the
      problem. Now a man wants to be decent, and the Catholic Faith (I got Mary
      to tell me a lot about it, and I've read about it in some of my father's
      books), while it makes allowances for human nature and treats it in the
      most sympathetic way, does know how to keep it within bounds. Why, it's a
      regular school of Saints! And it honestly recognises that we're mortal;
      inheritors of original sin as the spark flies upward. Yet if we go and
      confess our sins and try to feel sorry for 'em, we receive the grace of
      the Sacrament of Penance and Absolution,&mdash;and we can then receive the
      Blessed Sacrament. And when we receive the Blessed Sacrament our souls are
      developed and fed from God Himself and enabled to dominate our bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you've been well instructed,&rdquo; said Ruth, astonished at this boy's
      clear exposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got Mary to tell me a lot about the Catholic Faith, and I've read
      Bellarmine and Saint Augustine and a lot of my father's books,&rdquo; repeated
      the boy, a little wearily. &ldquo;But what I like best,&rdquo; he said brightening
      again, &ldquo;is that the Church is down on divorce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hasn't this singular boy reflected upon,&rdquo; thought Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few years I'm going to take the money my father left me, marry, and
      go abroad and be a writer, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; declared Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&mdash;that might not be a bad idea. Have you selected the young
      lady?&rdquo; Ruth enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking about, among the girls here,&rdquo; Jack answered, &ldquo;but I
      don't find any I can fall in love with,&rdquo; he added plaintively. &ldquo;They're
      all rather silly and superficial. I should like to find someone like you,&rdquo;
       he declared with abrupt enthusiasm. &ldquo;Someone who's pretty, someone who's a
      soft sweet voice, thinks about things,&mdash;likes to read, that sort of
      thing. Yes,&rdquo; he said, gazing at her, &ldquo;if you were younger or I older, I
      should like you to marry me, I should ask you to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no divorce,&rdquo; Ruth threatened merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No divorce? No&mdash;of course not!&rdquo; said Jack in sober disgust. &ldquo;When
      once we're married it's for better for worse. I shall say that from the
      first. Don't we always have to live with people we quarrel with at first?
      Look at my mother and Mary. She was for flouncing that girl from the house
      the first week, and Mary gave notice, day after she got in. Then they
      shook down and my mother thinks Mary's a treasure and Mary'd cut her hand
      off for my mother. She would for me, told me so. Gives me all the cream
      and pie I want, never tells when I come in late from the Post Office. No,
      the sooner you find out you're tied to the person you love by a hard knot
      for life,&mdash;the sooner you realise that marriage is a Sacrament, the
      sooner&mdash;if you've got an ounce of sense and the Catholic Faith to
      help you&mdash;you learn to shake down and be happy. Besides, my wife
      shall be in love with me and she'll do exactly as I like,&rdquo; declared Master
      Jack Enderfield.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IX
    </h3>
    <p>
      A gay jingle-jangle, the concord of sleigh-bells, the muffled piaffering
      of horses' hoofs and the door-knocker went again rat-tat.... Voices
      sounded in the hall, Rutherford and Robert Leffingwell entered the room,
      Jack's tête-à-tête was interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Adgate,&rdquo; said Jack, abruptly. He cast a scowl of dislike
      at the jovial face of Rutherford. Before Ruth could make reply Jack was
      out the front door, and his friend had a glimpse of a pair of boyish legs
      leaping the offset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid way of getting rid of obstacles,&rdquo; Rutherford said as he followed
      Miss Adgate's eyes, &ldquo;but what an odd boy it is! We're in for a blizzard,
      Miss Adgate,&rdquo; added he, and he approached the fire and cheerfully rubbed
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Blizzard!&rdquo; cried Ruth. She ran to the window, followed by her two
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Ruth and the two young men watched the flakes descend....
      They seemed to fall, fall, from limitless Niagaras of snow, from regions
      without the world, whose fountain-heads, beyond the skies, might be
      situate in those wastes of storm and cloud, where a Teutonic Mythology
      places its gods. The trees swayed gently, but even as Ruth watched them
      they had begun to bend in torture under a furious gale. Clouds of snow
      rose and fell like the billows of the sea....
    </p>
    <p>
      The temperature capriciously dropped to far below zero. Had not Jobias
      been prepared for this by previous knowledge, the house might have become
      uninhabitable. But Jobias knew his business and stood by the furnace. All
      that day and evening he watched it, fed it;&mdash;and left his post from
      time to time only to replenish with fresh baskets of logs the voracious
      fireplaces in the drawing-rooms, casting above the baskets of wood a
      paternal smile, an indulgent glance upon those idle ones gathered round
      the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sledges, meantime, drove up. Guests departed, guests arrived, unruffled by
      stress of weather. All, rather, were most obviously exhilarated by it.
      Ruth's friends were in the maddest spirits. Punch flowed, quips, cranks,
      peals of laughter made the house resound. The Blizzard adding, at it
      always does, a fresh elixir, more oxygen to the already supercharged New
      England atmosphere, Ruth, too, felt unaccountably elated. Her eyes
      sparkled while the winds howled and hooted, and bullied and tore; the
      unassuaged tempers of five thousand demons seemed about to take their fill
      of hate upon an innocent, well-meaning world, but a rosy colour bloomed in
      Miss Adgate's usually pale cheeks. She had never appeared to such
      advantage; she had never looked so lovely, appeared so brilliant, nor been
      so amusing. Rutherford, as though the storm had gone to his head,
      Rutherford watching her covertly, vowed he could throw himself at her feet
      before the roomful, and Ruth's intuitions warned her; she had a feminine
      inkling of danger. She chatted and she laughed from her corner by the
      table laden with excellent things to eat; but she kept Rutherford at arm's
      length the while her fancy began to draw a picture of Pontycroft, standing
      it beside Rutherford. For the first time, she perceived that General
      Adgate recalled Pontycroft in a measure. Tall, thin, spare, his aquiline
      features were like Pontycroft's, his bearing was that of a distinguished
      man. &ldquo;He has Harry Pontycroft's air of knowing that he knows,&rdquo; reflected
      Ruth softly; tenderly to her soul she quoted a line Pontycroft long ago
      had ironically applied to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who Knows that he Knows, follow him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft loved to discourse for the pleasure of holding forth. General
      Aldgate was reticent. His voice was low, well modulated; one could not
      have helped listening to it, or to what he said; even though this had not
      been wise or witty if often touched with irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rutherford, of medium stature, had the neck of a bull. His skin,
      originally clear, was yet ensanguined by exposure to wind and weather; he
      liked an out-of-door life and since he was heir to a fortune and detested
      the counting house, his life went in hunting, shooting, and fishing. He
      had a shock of black hair, clear black eyes, rather an attractive habit of
      darting a keen glance at his interlocutor as he spoke&mdash;a glance that
      seemed to grasp all there was to see, hidden or upon the surface, in a
      flash. But his voice was nasal, his words rushed, spluttered to be free;
      they issued chopped in two and left the idea unformulated. It required
      some familiarity with the American vernacular to understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he, a college man!&rdquo; scoffed Miss Adgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant&mdash;while Ruth indulged, I grieve to acknowledge it,
      the spirit of mockery&mdash;a thunderous crash broke the unison of lively
      voices. The score of people in the rooms flew to the windows. There,
      tossed to earth, abased from glory, prone upon the ground&mdash;imploring
      boughs lifted to heaven, a wreck&mdash;there lay the monster Adgate elm,
      one of the hoary elms in the carriage sweep. It lay there as neatly cut as
      with a scimitar. The splendid tree was literally slashed in twain by the
      Blizzard's invisible weapon, the prostrate thing loomed, portentous, to
      twenty pairs of eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the rest, Ruth stared at the fallen King. There was a lump in her
      throat.... No one spoke.... Every man and woman in the room had waxed
      intimate with that old tree, had come to man's or woman's estate beside
      it; they had played under it, insensibly had come to love it, as a part of
      themselves, as a piece of their pleasant, happy lives. This comrade and
      landmark was, too, one of the pardonable vanities of Oldbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise Heaven it wasn't the roof,&rdquo; said, at length, the Master of
      Barracks Hill. He knew, though, he would have preferred to have it the
      roof. A roof may be replaced. His niece even, did not suspect the passion
      of attachment any plant or tree upon his land could stir in him upon
      occasion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perseveringly the snowflakes descended. They continued to fall, fall,
      fall, for another thirty-six hours. The wind next morning, though, had
      stopped, and debris of yesterday's storm had been removed. A trackless
      white garment of snow spread to the furthest reaches of Barracks Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all very weird,&rdquo; said Ruth to Miranda, as, side by side, they sat
      and gazed on leagues and leagues of the white silence. &ldquo;Miranda, this is
      all very well&mdash;Blizzards are very stirring; simple homely pleasures
      are very pleasing, this landscape is <i>very beautiful</i>, but,&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
       Ruth suppressed a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, why will young men make geese of themselves? One can't get away
      from him, Miranda; a Blizzard even, does not keep him away! Miranda! If
      there's an object, my dear kitten, I detest, it's a sentimental young
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said Ruth, nonchalantly, to General Adgate that evening after
      supper, as, with Miranda purring snugly beside her, the three sat together
      in the drawing-room, &ldquo;I have an invitation from the Bolingbrokes, in
      Washington. They want me to come to them for a visit. Would you&mdash;would
      you miss me very much?&rdquo; she coaxed, and she went to him and laid a
      caressing hand on the old man's cheek&mdash;&ldquo;would you mind, very much, if
      I were to accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind, my dear?&rdquo; General Adgate looked at her. &ldquo;Who am I to say mind? You
      are your own mistress. Miss you? That's another pair of sleeves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I bring them back with me,&mdash;I mean the Bolingbrokes,&rdquo;
       laughed she. &ldquo;They're such dears.... You'd fall in love with her, the
      sauciest sprite in Christendom. And he'll welcome the occasion to talk
      international Politics with you! I believe,&rdquo; Ruth teased,&mdash;she drew
      up the Empire settle before the fire, she took Miranda to her knees and
      sat down again; &ldquo;I believe that it's my Duty&mdash;to go&mdash;to go fetch
      them&mdash;to play with you.&rdquo; With a final nod of decision Miss Adgate
      placed two small, elaborately shod feet, in a pair of high-heeled,
      steel-embroidered Florentine shoes, upon the fender; she began, with equal
      decision, to remove the wrappers from <i>The Athenoum, The Saturday Review</i>
      and a couple of <i>Morning Posts</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go&mdash;my dear,&rdquo; said the old man gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! I feel like a brute,&rdquo; thought Miss Adgate. &ldquo;What will he do if I
      return to England? Oh, why will people get fond of people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miranda purred.... The fire responded; a crisp, little musical
      crepitation; the flames licked the wood, the logs consumed themselves, in
      a cadenced song of happy Death and blessed Eternity. Punctured by this
      music silence entered, cozily, warmly descended upon the New England
      drawing-room.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ISS ADGATE
      accepted the Bolingbrokes' invitation. She spent six weeks of gaiety in
      Washington. Indeed it was refreshing to live in the world again, to mix
      with people of the world; to have cogent reasons for dressing exquisitely
      every night for dinner, to be taken in to dinner by a facetious attaché,
      by, even, a complacent, redundant railway magnate; or, happy compromise,
      by a Member of the Cabinet, for it is well known that a Cabinet Minister
      may be amusing. Through the interchange of frivolities and banter one
      could rise, not to more important matters,&mdash;is anything much more
      important to the world than the light touch and a witty conversation? But
      Miss Adgate found refreshment in living again among people whose thoughts
      were sometimes occupied by questions impersonal, of more or less
      consequence to the world's history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone possessed of a grain of humour has assured us that the &ldquo;World is a
      good old Chum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate found the world at Washington a very good old chum during
      those six weeks. &ldquo;In all but the aesthetic sense,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;America
      is an interesting land to live in.&rdquo; Plentiful wherever she went,
      tittle-tattle, supplemented by her own observations, helped her to form an
      idea of how this unwieldy bulk of a nation calling itself The United
      States of America was being rescued from fatuous chaos, a mass of
      political corruption and a superfluity of wealth, and lifted into an
      arrogant, resolute Power. But a Power whose outlook was as far removed
      from the simple hardy traditions of Puritan America as Earth is from
      Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      An oligarchy of able men,&mdash;a handful,&mdash;chosen, directed,
      inspired by a man yet abler, more audacious than they,&mdash;these were
      moulding, had already changed the destiny, the policy of the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Adgate recognised the efforts of the Man at the Helm. He had followed
      a fixed idea, and the idea was the Greater Glory of his Country; he had
      secured with his henchmen indisputable prestige to the Nation, and, thanks
      to his star, his tenacity, his temerity, America,&mdash;feared to-day if
      not honoured, was powerful. But not alas approved of! &ldquo;Damn approval!&rdquo;
       (the worm will turn,&mdash;the watchword passed through the land). &ldquo;We are
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo; went very far. This at least was the modest, unexpressed
      opinion of Miss Adgate,&mdash;it was shared, apparently, by the Man at the
      Helm. He lectured the Nation like a father. The Nation knowing itself to
      be unwholesome, inchoate, something ruthless, listened meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ruth reflected from the vantage of a calm and sympathetic
      observation: &ldquo;So many religions, no Faith! Where every man, in
      disobedience to Christ, chooses to be his own Pope. Yet the Holy Father
      has dedicated America to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.... But the
      very elements in America, so violent and so ferocious,&mdash;the burning
      Summers, the cruel Winters, the appalling cataclysms of Nature, if these
      are reproduced in the violent characters of the people, inclined to rape
      and rapine on a big or a little scale&mdash;at what end, <i>left to its
      own devices</i>, will the American character issue? Will it,&rdquo; she
      wondered, &ldquo;become, inflated with power, the great Master Robber of the
      World? Or will it perish utterly, hoist by its own petard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Convertere ad Dominum Deum.</i>&rdquo;... Mournful and
      tender, in the melodious, yearning, touching accents of Tenebrae, the
      phrase filled her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man at the Helm,&rdquo; she sorrowfully said to herself, &ldquo;shall save us for
      more than his few years of tenure. The race cries for direction, a sane
      outlet to its emotions. The sole influence which holds anarchy at bay is
      Holy Mother Church, wise men tell us. Yes, the Divine Authority!.. The
      sweet miracle of the Catholic Faith may save our people from ending as a
      nation of brutes; may open to us the gates of Humility and show to us the
      road to the 'Greater Glory of God.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, Miss Adgate woke with a start from her musings. She shook her
      pretty head. She returned to the practice of light banter and witty
      causerie, the only efficacious methods within reach, she reflected, of
      furthering the millennium her fancy painted for her native land.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little dear Ruth,&rdquo; Lucilla wrote, &ldquo;we're coming on the most important
      mission to America. Namely, to see you. Yes, and haven't I a bagful of
      news for your Royal Highness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sail by the <i>Cedric</i> on the fifteenth of April, Harry can't leave
      until then. To confess the truth, he is in Altronde. Civillo,&mdash;of
      course you've seen it by the papers,&mdash;Civillo is gone to a greater
      Principality, Bertram is King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see you&mdash;oh! And Ruth, I burn with curiosity to look on
      that New England of yours. Harry, I'm convinced, is prepared to settle
      there. He says, so pathetically, that at his time of life he feels the
      need of planting cabbages and that the Upper Gardener at Pontycroft gives
      notice when he tries to. He's heard that in New England gardeners are
      kind, don't mind a bit; they just let you plant, right down; are affable;
      make you settle right down and become one of 'em. But Harry says, too, he
      pines at first hand to solve the inwardness of a land destined to dominate
      us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, between you and me, in confidence, if America is to be the future
      of Europe&mdash;well&mdash;then I'm glad I shall be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But between you and me, my dear, what Henry Pontycroft wants is not so
      much to plant cabbages neither is it to study politics... What he
      truly-truly wants is a glimpse of the Young Person. He's missed you! Ah! I
      have news. Your devoted, Lucilla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over this flippant missive Ruth grew hot, then cold, then faint. And she
      sat, for a long moment in a state of emotional upheaval, of senseless
      vacuity&mdash;the while her head whirled and her heart went thump, thump,
      thump! It was an entire quarter of an hour before this commotion subsided,
      and left her with soft flutterings at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're coming, they're coming, they're coming! He's coming... I shall
      hear his voice, I shall see him. Oh, what has happened? Is it possible
      that he's free? Oh, my God, my God, help me to wait,&rdquo; she cried. She began
      to cry and to sob like a little child. She craved, wanted, longed for,
      unendurably, overwhelmingly, that he should take her in his arms, caress
      and fondle her, and, like a veritable little girl pat her cheek and soothe
      her, let her unburden her woes, let her lie, her head in his breast, while
      he said to her, &ldquo;There, little child, there, don't cry.&rdquo; And it was in
      Pontycroft's voice that the words fell upon her ears, and it was on Harry
      Pontycroft's breast that she dried her eyes. And they were Pontycroft's
      eyes into which her eyes smiled, when, presently, mocking him through her
      tears, but in oh, such heaven of bliss! she repeated the trite refrain of
      the tritest, the most foolish of Ballads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's hands!&rdquo; said Ruth; she dried her eyes. &ldquo;Like everything
      else....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hat and jacket on and went for a walk. When she reached the
      house an hour later, she had found her peace, and though her eyes were
      singularly bright and her manner curiously vivacious, this contributed the
      more to her success of the evening at the Bolingbrokes'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Bolingbroke rushed at her, enfolded her in an impetuous
      hug, &ldquo;you're delicious! Stay in Washington. Stay in Washington for ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to Barracks Hill with me,&rdquo; answered the young lady. &ldquo;I must be
      flitting almost at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no....&rdquo; protested Mrs. Bolingbroke. But it was peaceably arranged
      at last that the Bolingbrokes, having a <i>congé</i> at Easter, should
      come, then, to Barracks Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, on the fifteenth day of March, Ruth bade farewell to Washington
      and travelled back to Oldbridge.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      One long month and one entire week to wait. If Time was interminable,
      Miss Adgate resolved to make Time bear fruit. She took herself in hand.
      She tried to quell the little tremors of joy which kept welling up in her
      throat when she thought of the end of those five weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll probably not come. They'll change their minds. If they do come&mdash;it's
      more than likely some nonsense of Lucilla's!... Well.... Besides I've
      other businesses to attend to,&rdquo; the lady said with a most determined air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the least profitless way of passing those interminable days, Ruth set
      herself to the task of enhancing the natural beauties of Barracks Hill.
      She caused paths to be cut through the woods; she enlarged the flower
      gardens; she prepared the Morris House for her June visitors. As to the
      library and the music-room they had long since been ready for occupation.
      And in the interim of labour Miss Adgate gave a series of children's
      parties, calling Jackie Enderfield to her assistance. Her invitations
      vested in that young gentleman's hands, he became cock-of-the-walk among
      the girls and boys of Oldbridge and Rutherford was thus kept at bay. Yet
      notwithstanding these spartan derivatives, Ruth walked on clouds, smiling
      at love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She breathes roses and lilies,&rdquo; Miss Deborah Massington declared with
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighty, thereabout, Miss Deborah was sister to Mrs. Leffingwell and her
      junior by ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has charm,&rdquo; Mrs. Leffingwell answered, discreetly, while they watched
      Ruth's erect young buoyant figure disappear beyond the lindens. &ldquo;She makes
      one feel that everything's all right&mdash;better to come. I wonder...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth liked an hour spent in these ladies' bow-window; gay and fragrant
      window, all vivid of sunshine, filled with blossoming geranium and
      heliotrope. While she entertained them with tales of Italy, which they
      could never hear enough about, Ruth Adgate reflected that the lives of her
      grandmothers must have been just such quiet, such repressed, contented
      lives as these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Leffingwell and Miss Massington, types of New England's most
      exquisite product&mdash;the old lady. The old lady who, with all her
      gentle unworldliness, is a patrician to her finger tips. As the perfume of
      rose-leaves is preserved in a fine porcelain jar&mdash;so the hushed
      fragrance of these temperate lives emanates, yet stays, to the end. White,
      ethereal, peaceful&mdash;and pictorially the replicas of Whistler's
      mother, these two ladies were waited upon by a black servant, whose
      gorgeous head-gear was the red, blue, and yellow bandanna. Each lady had
      her window in the low-ceilinged, white-panelled drawing-room; each was
      clad in good black silk; on each white head a cap reposed of fine Honiton
      lace&mdash;and their gowns were finished with a transparent lace collar
      and cuffs. Both ladies were slightly deaf; both were omnivorous readers,
      both were eager listeners; both had the sense of humour; and both were
      indulgent amused lookers-on at the small games of life which they were no
      longer privileged to take part in; and if gracious patience be a virtue
      these ladies may well be considered beautiful products of a fast vanishing
      Puritan tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Easter fell on the twenty-third of April. The Bolingbrokes arrived at
      Barracks Hill the day before Easter, but on the morning of their arrival
      came a disastrous piece of news. Almost the whole of Ruth's fortune had
      been swept out of existence overnight in one of those cataclysmic
      melodramas which melodramatic Nature loves to enact in the United States.
      On Good Friday, the twenty-first of April, nineteen hundred and eight, the
      town of Wyoming was annihilated by a tornado. The merry monster chose the
      small hours before midnight, when, giving rein to his pranksome
      cubfulness, he swept men, women, children into Eternity with hardly a
      warning.... The mines&mdash;they formed the <i>raison d'être</i> of the
      town&mdash;caved in, flooded by a water spout. The entire district was
      reduced to desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at breakfast, in the crispest of white morning confections, Ruth
      became informed of this and of her losses through the medium of the
      Oldbridge <i>Morning Herald</i>, whose items she was reading aloud, a
      concession, to her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Adgate, far more than his lovely niece, was affected by the news.
      Had he not enjoyed vicariously the sense of her wealth? It had tickled his
      fancy as well as his family pride to see her squander with a lavish hand,
      without so much as a thought of the value of money. It had pleased his
      sense of the incongruous that notwithstanding the obvious joy she took in
      opening her fingers, in letting the gold slide through them, she had
      acquiesced in, nay adopted, many of the Spartan habits of New England; New
      England&mdash;which has never been purse-proud because she has never,
      until lately, had very much money in her purse. Ruth, indeed, had all she
      could do to cheer General Adgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all is lost, save honour,&rdquo; she consoled, &ldquo;<i>I</i> have still some
      investments in England by the mercy of which I shall not be poverty
      stricken. I've as much as three thousand safe pounds a year coming from
      there, you old darling,&rdquo; she cooed. &ldquo;Harry Pontycroft invested it for me
      long ago. That ought to be enough for any woman with economical tastes,&rdquo;
       she assured him. &ldquo;And I've a lot in the bank,&mdash;Heaven knows how much!
      I've never spent anything like my income for I had nothing which seemed
      worth spending it upon,&mdash;since, ugh!&mdash;I detest automobiles, and
      you know it. We can still keep open house this summer and never trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of a truth, Miss Adgate experienced relief,&mdash;why?&mdash;she did not
      try to fathom&mdash;at the thought of her diminished fortunes. She might,
      possibly, this blithe adventuress, or had she not been expecting guests,
      she might, even, have tried to persuade General Adgate to lead her to the
      scene of the disaster. I doubt, though, if she would have succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fat cheque went instead by the Red Cross Society to the relief of the
      sufferers. And lo! the diminishing days were dwindled to a pinpoint.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Bolingbroke heard that Henry Pontycroft and Lucilla Dor were on
      the sea, bound for America, she could not contain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Ruth, what are they comin' for?&rdquo; she exclaimed, wide-eyed,
      gazing at Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; said Ruth, putting her nose into a bowlful of fresh roses
      from Rutherford's hot-houses. &ldquo;Oddly enough, to see me, perhaps?&rdquo; she
      added, laughing, and she made an effort to look her friend squarely and
      jocosely in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bolingbroke penetratedly to her husband, &ldquo;Ruth Adgate
      is either the most consummate actress or the most innocent dove the good
      God has ever, in His ability, wrought from the dust of which we are made.
      If the Pontycrofts are on the sea it's for some extraordinary reason. Ruth
      either suspects that reason, or she doesn't. But she looked at me with
      those clear guileless eyes of hers, when she mentioned their coming, and
      I, for one, can imagine any man telling her he'd burn Troy Town for such a
      glance. Yet there's that Mr. Rutherford&mdash;crazily in love with her,
      I'm told,&mdash;a splendid match as Americans go. She could marry him and
      his money to-morrow if she liked. And since she's so daft about New
      England, she could send him into politics and have quite a life. It will
      be interesting to see how the Pontycrofts will act when they find the
      sources of her income are swept away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not a proper remark for you to make, my dear,&rdquo; replied the
      Honourable Richard Bolingbroke, in a tone of unexpected severity. &ldquo;Henry
      Pontycroft's a sensitive, quixotic, high-minded, honourable English
      gentleman. He's rich, moreover. Money plays no part in his coming. Lady
      Dor I've known since I was a boy. She was a delightful girl, just as now
      she's a charming woman. They'll be admirable additions to the house party,
      and that's all that concerns you or me. Pontycroft will keep us in roars
      of laughter and I'm curious to meet him in New England. You may be sure
      he'll like this wonderful old place. He'll feel all the arid romance of
      this aristocratic passionate bleak land. Who knows? He may be the Prince
      come to wake it, humanise it, with a kiss. Oldbridge will not have looked
      upon his like&mdash;it won't have heard anything to compare with him,
      either, in its three hundred years of existence; never will again; I hope
      it may make the best of its opportunity to give him a royal welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel crushed,&rdquo; pouted Mrs. Bolingbroke. &ldquo;How should I, who've never met
      Henry Pontycroft&mdash;know he's the paragon of wit and chivalry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's precisely what Henry Pontycroft is,&rdquo; her husband answered gravely,
      &ldquo;He <i>is</i> the paragon of wit and chivalry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These young folk were pacing side by side in the moonlit garden after the
      excellent New England repast, called supper; while Miss Adgate and her
      uncle were busy with callers, upon the veranda. The night was the first of
      a long series of warm May nights, the moon hung, majestic and round, over
      the fringes of wood termed the Wigwam. A rustic bench stood invitingly
      under the big syringa, now a perfumed canopy of white. As they stood on
      the upper terrace it was easy to distinguish descending terraces marked by
      rows of silvery budding irises swollen or in bloom.... The magic smells of
      white and purple lilac were touched with a whiff of apple blossoms from
      the hill and beyond&mdash;below&mdash;the Mantic gleamed in the moonlight
      amid trees all a feathery, spring incrustation of minute green foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a divine spot,&rdquo; said Bolingbroke, suddenly kissing his wife, &ldquo;but
      we must rejoin the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla Dor and Harry Pontycroft arrived the following day and were
      installed in the Morris House at the other side of the hill, where two
      neat Irish girls waited upon them under the enlightening, tempered
      instruction of Pontycroft's man and of Lucilla's maid.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spring was abroad in her witchery. She had come with a rush, with a good
      will, with an&mdash;abundance, 'and all of a sudden-like'&mdash;as she
      has, after many days of dallying, a way of doing in New England. She had
      been coy; she had flirted; she had tantalised&mdash;a day here, a day
      there&mdash;with dewy warmth of soft blue skies, her robes diaphanous
      April cloud. Then she had veiled her face, vexed for one knew not what
      offences,&mdash;had turned her coldest shoulder, shed her most frigid
      tears. She had looked forth, wreathed again in smiles, while she put
      wonder-working fingers to shrubs and branches... and again she had
      withdrawn herself in deepest greyest dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, she was come, come. The birds were building and calling and
      fluttering, in all the emotion, the refreshing joy of an ever-renewed
      bridalhood. A young male wren who had discovered a bird-house, fixed on
      the off-chance of so happy an event as to entice him there&mdash;by
      Jobias, to the top of a rustic pole in the rose garden&mdash;tore his
      throat open in the rapture of telling the world what a place for a nest he
      had found, and how sweet she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameless uxorious creature,&rdquo; Ponty said, as he came over the hill and
      paused to listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unaccountably enough, Ruth, as he came into the garden, Ruth issued from
      the house dressed in white; dressed in white, without a hat, a watteau
      sunshade in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, my pretty maid,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, &ldquo;you're not going
      a-milking in that costume, are you?&rdquo; He eyed her sharply with the
      quizzical glint she knew well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Ruth answered, in perfect composure. Yet at the
      anticipation of seeing Pontycroft alone, she had many times felt the earth
      quake under her,&mdash;&ldquo;I'm going to call upon Lucilla,&rdquo; she vouchsafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lucilla's knocked up. I came with a message from her. She wants me to
      say she's had her breakfast in bed and won't rise until luncheon.
      Lucilla's tired from the journey. You two women must have talked
      yourselves weary, if a mere man may judge of such matter. Oh, the hour at
      which I caught sight of Paolina conducting you over the hill last night!&rdquo;
       said Ponty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a beautiful moonlit night,&rdquo; said Ruth, inhaling the morning air
      with delight, &ldquo;and so,&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;What a surprise it was, though, to find the
      Bolingbrokes here. He's a decent chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like them very much,&rdquo; Ruth said, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your uncle,&rdquo; Ponty proceeded, &ldquo;I like <i>him</i> very much,&rdquo; he
      paraphrased. &ldquo;We held an uproarious pow-wow in the library, the three of
      us, last night, while you women discussed chiffons in the music-room.
      By-the-bye, that was rather a nice thing that somebody played,&rdquo; and Ponty
      hummed the first bars of the Valse Lente. &ldquo;You were the musician, I
      suspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Ruth said, negligently. They were standing beside the
      flight of stone steps which leads from the rose-garden to the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the Bolingbrokes?&rdquo; enquired Pontycroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone for the day, with the Wetherbys, on their yacht. It's a party of
      twelve and they expect to come back by moonlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why, pray, were not the rest of us included?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth began to laugh. &ldquo;They did include the rest of us,&rdquo; she answered.
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the use of beating about the bush in this fashion? You've
      something to tell me, I hear. Say it.&rdquo; And leaving Pontycroft to consider
      her suggestion Ruth ran up the steps and fled lightly over the carpet
      woven of white saxifrage and violets thickly strewn among the turf, to the
      bench under the big oak at the summit of the hill. Here she sat herself,
      opened her blush-rose sunshade and defiantly watched Pontycroft stroll
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed. He stood, deliberating before her for a moment. Then, bending
      a knee:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Royal Highness, will your Royal Highness accept the Crown of
      Altronde from the hands of the King's unworthy Ambassador?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth caught her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she queried, in a most violent disappointment of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gracious Majesty,&rdquo; answered Pontycroft, &ldquo;I mean,&mdash;that I am
      come all the way from Europe and from a certain small but
      not-to-be-sneezed-at Principality called Altronde in order to ask you to
      wear with King Bertram, the ermine and the purple.... If we must put it
      bluntly, the King implores you to share his throne, his heart and his
      crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Ruth said, &ldquo;how very absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all absurd,&rdquo; said Pontycroft; he still knelt, one knee to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he looks every inch Ambassador and not in the least ridiculous,&rdquo; Ruth
      thought smiling to herself, &ldquo;in this superlatively ridiculous posture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Queen Mama is more than anxious to welcome you with wide-open arms,&rdquo;
       continued Pontycroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo; Ruth slightly raised her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's true she kicked a bit,&rdquo; said Ponty. He got to his feet and with
      his handkerchief flapped a straw or two from his knee. &ldquo;But Bertram made a
      devil of a row; there was no standing it she explained to me with tears in
      her eyes. The Queen Mama has had to capitulate, and Bertram's counting
      these very moments as ever are, pining to hear you have accepted him. I'm
      to go <i>de ce pas</i> to the telegraph office and wire 'yes'&mdash;so
      soon as you've made your haughty little mind up that you'll have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Ruth said. &ldquo;It is very interesting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly she felt her heart leap into her throat. She trembled, yet
      she spoke resolutely. &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Harry&mdash;you've told me
      something startling and&mdash;not very important. But why don't you tell
      me that the woman who wrote the letter&mdash;is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unaccountable stillness fell for an instant over the landscape. Ruth
      left her bench under the oak and walked off, walked away to where the
      rocks come cropping up along the brow of the hill. The panorama spread
      before her was one of fresh, palely verdant meadows and woods; the Mantic,
      turbulent from spring freshets, was bordered with trees in the early
      paleness of their green leaves; the green frail rondures of the Wigwam
      foliage in delicate and varied shades,&mdash;these were dappled with
      sunlight and blue sky. A far panoply of purple hills, marking the
      borderland, shutting away the boisterous outer world as by a charmed
      circle, enclosed the small, the joyous world of the little inland town,
      the valley and the seven hills of Oldbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft approached mechanically, slowly. He stood by Ruth's side, he
      looked off with her at this exquisite efflorescence of spring in the new
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beautiful view,&rdquo; he said, in a matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;Europe could
      scarcely do better.... And so Lucilla told you?&rdquo; he queried, carelessly.
      &ldquo;Put not thy trust in woman. She vowed by her most sacred vows she'd never
      say a word until I told her to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I wormed it out of her,&rdquo; Ruth replied, laughing, and,&mdash;it
      was too apparent,&mdash;she was laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite gather what it is that makes you so merry this morning,&rdquo;
       said Pontycroft; &ldquo;unless it is this heavenly Spring day, and that's enough
      for twenty hopes and fears to rap and knock and enter in our souls.... But
      please do recollect that while you loiter, considering the indisputably
      lovely landscape, there's a chap in Altronde waiting&mdash;impatient's no
      word for it&mdash;for a wire. Kindly give your attention to the Royal
      Incident, the real question of actuality, for a moment, and let me be off
      as soon as possible to the Post Office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long ago, I seem to remember,&rdquo; Ruth said, slowly, &ldquo;long ago, I seem to
      hear myself saying in a garden in Florence, that the Royal Incident was
      closed. It is closed. I haven't changed my mind, on the contrary. If you
      must of your will leave my hill at this perfect hour and&mdash;and be
      sending messages to the other side of the world&mdash;then, you needs
      must! But&mdash;pray remember your own favourite saw, that 'opportunity
      comes once in a lifetime.' Jobias goes home at noon, can't he take your
      message? If Prince, I beg his pardon, King,&mdash;if Bertram has to live
      in suspense for a few hours, let that be my little revenge. 'If it feed
      nothing else, it will feed my revenge,'&rdquo; laughed Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given expression to this heartless sentiment, she began to tread,
      cautiously, among the flowers&mdash;the saxifrage, the violets, the little
      green-golden buttercups between,&mdash;her light steps responding with
      love to what she was pleased to think was their caress. From the plain and
      from the woods mounted gentle homely sounds, the hautbois of the New
      England Spring&mdash;the blows of a distant axe, the felling of trees, a
      carpenter's hammer taptapping,&mdash;and children's cries resounding as
      they romped at play; all mounted together, in a joyous choiring, with
      birds' songs and twitterings which fell about them from every tree far and
      near; the earth, the sky&mdash;musical, alive with carols and
      thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bring a garland for your head of flowers fresh and fair,&rdquo; Ruth hummed,
      pacing a little ahead of Pontycroft, and her foot rhythmically touched
      ground at each stress of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I had, once, a double double grandmother,' my friend Jack Enderfield is
      fond of saying,&rdquo; said Ruth, as she continued her walk to the measure of
      the verse. &ldquo;A great, great, so great <i>Meregrand!</i> She was French. Her
      name was Priscilla. Priscilla Mulline. She's rather a person in New
      England History&mdash;you'll forgive my mentioning her. When the man she
      cared for came, as emissary from the man she didn't care for, to ask her
      to marry him&mdash;do you remember what she answered?&rdquo; Ruth kept her eyes
      fixed upon the tips of her toes, and they, like little mice, little white
      mice, went in and out, below the flounces of her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontycroft gasped,&mdash;took a step towards her. But his lean and bony
      face, which for a moment had betrayed him, assumed again the look of
      disillusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;the foolish girl made hash of her future, perpetrated
      a <i>mot</i> which, no doubt, she lived to repent. A <i>mot</i> which one
      of your American poets has quite suitably recorded. By it, Miss Priscilla
      Mulline lost her chance of making a very good match. She lost her golden
      opportunity. She cut off her chances of having a jolly good time in a big,
      jolly world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're abominable,&rdquo; Ruth said, and permitted herself two actions very
      much at variance,&mdash;she stamped her foot and she smiled obliquely at
      the object of her wrath. &ldquo;You're abominable. I want you to tell me what
      she answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've forgotten it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've well-nigh forgotten it
      myself.... I believe, though, she did ask the chap Alden why the deuce
      (pardon the expletive) he didn't speak for himself. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why didn't he?&rdquo; enquired Ruth, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was a duffer, I suppose,&rdquo; said Ponty, with a fine effect of
      ending the discussion. &ldquo;But now, my dear young one, be serious. Here's
      your chance....&rdquo; Pontycroft's voice became argumentative. &ldquo;I've crossed
      the ocean to lay a crown at your feet. A crown from which you may get
      considerable fun and splendour. Bertram's rich, you're rich. You are, both
      of you, handsome, virtuous, clever, and at the mating age. You can make of
      your little Principality, your Kingdom, the centre of the enlightenment
      and art of Europe. Find me a philosopher, an artist, or a man of wit who
      doesn't appreciate a King! Under your wise encouragement Art, at last,
      will come into her own.... Oh, think of the poor devils of hangers-on of
      Genius you'll be able to lift from Purgatories of obscurity into the
      light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've made one trifling mistake,&rdquo; interrupted Ruth; &ldquo;there's something I
      have not told you, an element you must omit from the equation of that
      Castle in Altronde you are building for me. I'm not rich.... The Town of
      Wyoming, let me tell you, is no more. My millions, and a good thing too&mdash;have
      collapsed. They've shrunken to the few thousands you invested, ages ago,
      do you remember? in British Consols? On them I shall run this dear old
      place,&mdash;I shall dress, modestly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, Ruth, Ruth!&rdquo; interrupted Pontycroft, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it all occurred about a week ago while you were at sea, and that, I
      suppose, is why you didn't hear of it. These accidents, here in America,
      happen so often. Marconi didn't find the item of sufficient importance, I
      dare say, to give it a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.... Here's a kettle of fish! Whew!&rdquo; whistled Pontycroft. &ldquo;You young
      limb of mischief, why didn't you tell me? <i>Ouf</i>&rdquo; cried he, with a
      great pant of relief. &ldquo;<i>Ouf</i>,&mdash;poor Bertram! He has no luck.&rdquo;
       They had been sauntering, backwards and forward, over a grassy road which
      runs up hill and down dale through the green-sward planted with apple
      trees. Pontycroft leaned, now, against a tree. He gazed at Ruth without a
      word. A rosy-tipped cluster of apple blossoms nodded just above his head.
      He reached up, plucked it; and offered it to the lady with the crimson
      sunshade who stood in the sunlight before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, Fairy Godmother! Feel my heart,'&rdquo; Ruth whispered, under her breath.
      &ldquo;I should like to show you my Riviera,&rdquo; she said hastily, reddening under
      his gaze, and she stuck the apple blossoms into her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth skirted the grey rocks which crop above the brow of the hill to the
      left. She led Pontycroft down a green bank to a patch of brighter green
      nestling for quite a distance under the shelter of the overhanging cliffs.
      Here were eglantine, here were violets in profusion; Solomon's seal, red
      and purple columbine; and the purple liverwort, and a shower of those
      frail white wind-flowers called anemones, although in no wise do they
      resemble their European cousins. Young ferns, pale green fronds, sprang
      vigorously from the clefts in the rocks, juniper and barberry bushes and a
      savin lent here and there a hardy note and an added shelter to the
      scattering of spring blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so exclusive here,&rdquo; laughed Ruth, taking a lichen-covered seat
      formed in the grey stone. &ldquo;These canny flowers have discovered the place
      for themselves after the habit of the land.... Sit down,&rdquo; she invited him.
      She crossed her hands in her lap, she looked towards him; a mischievous
      light glanced bewitchingly in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; Pontycroft began&mdash;he was trying, very hard, to resume
      his paternal air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't 'dear child' me any more&mdash;I haven't brought you here
      for that,&rdquo; petulantly cried Ruth. &ldquo;I won't have you for a father and I've
      already got an uncle, and I don't think you'd make, for me, a satisfactory
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Adgate,&rdquo; said Pontycroft, he possessed himself of one of her hands,
      and examining it carefully (it was, as we know a very white hand with slim
      and rosy fingers), &ldquo;Miss Adgate, I have a proposition to make to you.
      Since my schemes, since all my weary plottings and plannings for a Royal
      End for you, do, it seems, gang aft agley,&mdash;though, and mark my
      words, Bertram is no stickler for lucre; but since they've been knocked
      flat on the head by a blow of chance, let me suggest that we make a fresh
      start, let us consider a new alliance for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he laid a large bony hand tightly, as though afraid
      of its escape, over the little hand he held in his,&mdash;&ldquo;here is a
      novel, international situation, a situation, free, thank goodness, of any
      blessed complications. Shall you and I,&rdquo;&mdash;he lifted the hand to his
      lips again, he touched his lips tenderly to each finger-tip, and Ruth
      looked on&mdash;&ldquo;shall you and I get married? Shall we run this dear place
      together? Shall we love it, live in it? I had dreamed, for you, infant, of
      a royal end. What will you? Heaven mercifully disposes.... But I <i>had</i>
      dreamed for you a Royal End!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like being proposed to in this manner,&rdquo; said Ruth, rounding upon
      him with a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, blessed angel little Ruth!&rdquo; cried Pontycroft, letting
      himself go. &ldquo;Ruth... Hopelessly, hopelessly, denied me&mdash;found at
      last. Little Lady Precious Ruth! Ruth whom I love, Ruth whom I dote on&mdash;Ruth
      whom I've worshipped ever since she was a toddling child in her father's
      house... Ruth!&rdquo; Miss Adgate could feel the beating of Pontycroft's heart
      as she stayed against his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we live here together?&rdquo; he asked presently. &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;of
      course you love this old place! I love it because you do. And Thou,
      singing beside me in the Wilderness! It needs us, doesn't it? This
      peaceful Wilderness, this New England Garden of Eden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eden, from which William Rutherford has killed the snake,&rdquo; laughed Ruth
      blinking a crystal tear that rolled down her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rutherford?&rdquo; Pontycroft frowned, &ldquo;<i>who</i> is William Rutherford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nobody. No one in particular,&rdquo; Ruth hastened to reply. &ldquo;A mere mighty
      hunter before the Lord.&rdquo; And Pontycroft did not pursue the subject of
      William Rutherford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ruth a trifle anxiously, in a moment, &ldquo;we must go abroad from
      time to time? We could never forsake Pontycroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang Pontycroft. Lucilla shall have it for her kids.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want it for mine,&rdquo; said Ruth. Then she looked away and blushed crimson&mdash;and
      then she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the motto, Harry, of your house?&rdquo; she queried, irrelevantly.
      &ldquo;I've forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It once was,&rdquo; Pontycroft said, and he smiled at her: &ldquo;<i>Super mare,
      super fluvia.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once?&rdquo; said Ruth, a little shyly, &ldquo;<i>once?</i> And now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Constantia</i>, now, henceforth,&rdquo; he whispered with a throbbing of the
      heart.... &ldquo;But will your uncle be pleased at all this?&rdquo; he enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle?&rdquo; said Ruth, waking from a reverie. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;he would have
      liked me to marry Rutherford, I imagine. But if you're awfully nice to
      him, and if you let him see how infatuated you are with Barracks Hill&mdash;he'll
      end, I know, by giving me and you his blessing. But I won't give up
      England&mdash;and I want Italy, too,&mdash;Venice, Rome!&rdquo; wilfully
      persisted Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You precious little piece of covetous cosmopolitanism! Haven't you
      learned that if in Heaven, may be, it is given us to be everywhere&mdash;in
      this life: One Paradise, one Eden? In this world one Eden shall suffice,
      for things learned on earth may or may not be practised in Heaven; but
      love is, ever was, the language of repetition. In this life the lesson is
      to be contented with a single Paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Adgate, laying her hand on Ponty's mouth. &ldquo;Oh,
      middle-aged sentiment... not in the Catechism. Don't, I beg, say it
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized the hand, he pressed his lips to it, he pressed it against his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even an infant like you,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;let alone a world-worn chap like
      the man you propose to take as a husband, can't stand perpetual motion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Ruth compromised, &ldquo;shall we alternate with a year in England,
      one here, one in Italy, Jobias and Paolina to pack for us. That will make
      it easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; laughed Pontycroft, &ldquo;you shall see! The pendulum is bound to narrow
      its oscillations! We'll earn a well-needed rest,&mdash;<i>here</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh me!&rdquo; sighed Ruth, &ldquo;ah me!&rdquo; cried Ruth. &ldquo;In that event how charmed our
      ancestors will be. But, I forgot! You haven't heard the story.&rdquo; Ruth told
      it gaily and waited, curious to see what Harry Pontycroft would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear young one, these old four-posters,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;are the most
      dangerous things to sleep in,&rdquo; and Ruth was seized with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'll never sell them to the nearest dealer in old bric-a-brac.
      Rather,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;we'll do as you advised, we'll take the greatest
      care not to offend our forbears. But&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; her forefinger went
      up impressively, &ldquo;but a destiny was in preparation for us&mdash;I felt it,
      Harry, on the very day after I reached here. Harry, I felt, I knew,
      Destiny had something up her sleeve. The day I went for a walk alone,&rdquo;
       said Ruth, with a serious air. &ldquo;It is a delicious destiny... to be married
      in the little Parish church by that Saint of a Priest and to live here,
      'forever afterwards'!&rdquo; (with a malicious nod,) &ldquo;with a break now and then
      to Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moreover and because journeys end in lovers' meeting, we'll probably have
      a June wedding,&rdquo; Pontycroft unexpectedly suggested, wise in his
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A June wedding!... I've built better than I knew,&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth. &ldquo;I've
      asked a house party of friends, friends of yours, Lucilla's and mine, to
      come here in June. Let them haste to the wedding&mdash;I'll have Jackie
      Enderfield for page and he shall carry my train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another admirer,&rdquo; Ponty said resigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The merest bit of a boy of twelve. Without him, without my uncle, these
      wits like as not had perished utterly. Jack when he's a man intends to
      marry a woman with a low voice and a red glint in her hair. He will turn
      Catholic with my consent and go abroad and write. He doesn't believe
      either in Divorce&mdash;in other words, you perceive he <i>is</i> an
      intellectual. But,&rdquo; she said, rising, &ldquo;we've forgotten&mdash;oh, we've
      forgotten to send that message by Jobias to poor King Bertram! We shall
      have to take it ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henry Pontycroft and Ruth descended the hill along the violet-sprinkled
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; he urged, as they went their way, &ldquo;for conscience sake, consider,&mdash;consider,
      little Ruth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ah, consider.... It is not yet too late, infant,
      and I had dreamed for Ruth Adgate of a Royal End!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Miss Adgate replied; a little happy sigh escaped from her lips; she
      looked down at the apple blossoms in her belt,&mdash;strange to say, the
      apple blossoms were fresh as though just plucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; she replied, with a little quizzical look, &ldquo;I, too, had dreamed
      for Ruth Adgate of a Royal End.... Both our dreams have come true! <i>Love
      is the Royal End</i>.&rdquo;

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
